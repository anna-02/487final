If that same person chooses to drive, they also cannot properly drive. The person who chose to drive is the criminal because they have made choices that put others at risk. When a person has sex with the clearly intoxicated person, they have made the choice to put that person at risk for the emotional damage that comes with rape, as well as possible stds and possible pregnancy. If both people are clearly intoxicated, they both put each other at risk for these things and either can press charges on each other, or deal with it in a way that works for them."

Yet, instead of giving me access to said CBLs, or keeping me off the register, they still insist on making me run one. I'd actually love to see this store fined for it.

Each has some form of metal pertrusion, the bodies warped out of recognition as a result. We hear screams from behind a heavy, metal door. We enter the room; a filthy lab full of obsolete tech. A team of scientists labor around a screaming wretch who is strapped to a rusty metal table. One of them approaches with a large syringe. The wretch tries to fight the scientist off, but he can't. As the syringe enters his spinal column, he uses the large of his energy to scream before eventually passing out. The scientist forces the contents of the syringe down into the wretch, the liquid metal slowly entering his body. Another scientist fits electeopads to the wretch as the others leave the room. The last scientist leaves, closing the heavy, metal door behind him. The scientists enter another room, watching the wretch through a two way mirror. One nods to another, who presses a button on the control panel. Electricity starts to surge through the wretch. The scientist at the control panel turns a nob, increasing the power. The wretch starts to convulse. The nob is turned to MAXIMUM. After a few seconds, the two way mirror shatters into a million pieces, knocking over the scientists. One of them stands, peering through the shattered mirror. He sees the outline of a figure standing in the middle of the lab. He picks up his cracked glasses and places them on the end of his nose. His mouth slowly opens, aghast. He picks up a red telephone. It connects immediately. Scientist: Premier? Subject Omega was a success. Inside the lab, a hulking man stands, breathing slowly.

However, backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately established the new handheld console as the successor to the Game Boy series. This sounds really familiar. Before I read that, I was really confident that the guys at Nintendo won't kill the 3DS."

1,But but but my high school economics class taught me that increasing the minimum wage will directly increase inflation in a perfectly proportional manner which will cancel out all the benefits for the poor and make all the middle class worst off!,"Actually, yeah, it would. And you're right and that it's an issue of supply and demand. The economy starts at the bottom. The more money the poorer folks get, the more money moves. A lower class citizen usually can't save all that much, and will spend all they have. That money goes straight to *local* businesses. Now, if you gave people a decent, living wage, they'll be buying more of those local goods and services. Suddenly the demand for all those things increases, and the staff companies have is no longer sufficient. More jobs are created. More factories are required, production increases. It's all gains, brother! Now, instead let's imagine putting that money into tax breaks for the top. Do you think they spend that money on making more *jobs*? Of course not. The demand isn't there. That'll go towards more executive bonuses, et cetera. Money that'll go abroad to places that pander to the wealthy, like monoco, dubai, and so forth. TL;DR: You wanna fix the economy? A great first step is raising the minimum wage, country wide. Poor money earned is local money *spent*."

However, in my checking account there were two deposits made from my company: One for $200 and another for $195. It seemed as if there had been two paychecks submitted at slightly different amounts. As a precaution I told my boss and payroll and they said that their records showed no duplicates and only one deposited amount which I also confirmed through physical copy of the $200 paycheck. So, I kept the extra money in the account, untouched, as a further precaution and moved on thinking nothing of it. Today I was payed again and this time the paycheck was for $500.

They refuse to take care of the people who would inhabit it. Instead, everyone will exploit opportunities to make money and take it back to the suburbs. Detroit will always be a shithole."

0,You'll probably find your answer in r/legaladvice.,"Cockroaches in the workplace Over the course of the past 9 months my workplace seems to of had an influx in cockroaches. I hadn't seen them until around last winter. From any research I've done, I do believe they are brown banded cockroaches. They are rust colour at maturity and sort of clear with black on them when they are babies. They are horrible and I hate them. Now - squishing them, whatever, its gross and its horrible that it has to be done. BUT - my major concern is that they are going to crawl into my backpack, bicycle helmut or running shoes and I'll end up taking one home with me, effectively releasing them into my home to run rampant! From what I gather, cockroaches can also carry bacteria and contaminate food. I don't work with food or anything, but I do bring my lunches and snacks from home, as do other co-workers. We hang our personal items, but it has been suggested that we keep them in air tight containers. I think where I'm going with this is - at what point is my workplace LEGALLY required to shape up and get rid of the roaches? They've had pest control in to spray, but with the weather and humidity, sightings are still frequent. OR maybe they don't have legal obligation? I'm not sure and I didn't see anything super helpful online. Who would I notify to get the gears moving if my workplace doesn't seem to be taking the proper steps? THANKS!"

If they had shortened the movie, focused less on the love story aspect and got rid of scenes like the ""I'm king of thr world"" it would have been a much better movie i think. Just tried too hard to make it an epic and a classic in my opinion. Then Donnie Darko. In my junior and senior high school years I would have punched someone in the face for saying it but really that movie is pretty over rated. Still a good movie but I dont think it deserves the cult classic status that it eventually gained."

You gotta know when adapting a movie character there's gonna be changes, so maybe a different origin and more in-depth backstory would help him out. Who would you adapt? Too many cool non-canon characters not to be real."

Let's outlaw caffeine. If there's *any* legitimacy to the pot as a gateway drug argument, it's *because* pot is illegal, and you have to go to drug dealers to get it, and you're exposed to a world of harder drugs in the process. Legalizing it would stop this, not accentuate it. I don't even smoke pot, and the ""pot is a gateway drug"" argument pisses me off so much."

0,How about you tell me the name of your city and I'll tell you if you have any nests.,"My city has no nests, but some places have cluster spawns of biome pokemon. After long walks and some buses, I got to the conclusion that my city has no nests. (most parks don't even have the dark green color and have few spawn points). But I saw manny cluster spawns on normal streets, with the common pokemon (eevee, clefary, pidgey, weedle and caterpie), throughout the entire city. On the Atlas, some people reported nests, but all with no confirmation. I wanted to mark those clusters, but not to give false hope to fellow travelers, could we get a feature to mark this kind of points on the map? At least on small towns, this could make a difference."

One can be made relatively easily while the other is dangerous to produce or consume. I counter that the black market can survive in some form if an LCBO model is implemented. But it will survive because of the unique attributes of weed in comparison to alcohol, mainly the safety and transportation issues the come about for alcohol. It will rise and fall like tobacco when taxes punish consumption to an unacceptable level. Also when using the word ""legal"" here we are talking about a monopoly. One would hope that for legal sale of weed we are given more options as consumers. And because of that alcohol sale and consumption is a poor thing to compare this to or study when trying to implement a new market."

1,B-b-but Emily Rogers says they are ahead of schedule!,"I'm writing this going off the assumption that this article can be taken seriously: Yup, this is pretty much exactly what I figured was going down. Nintendo chose a far too ambitious launch date of March 2017 and now they're scrambling to try and meet it. I think that it's a good time to start emotionally preparing for the worst case scenario, that is a full delay of the launch until June/July 2017. It's seeming like best case scenario is a short run to make the March 2017 launch window and keep investors happy, with mass market stock not being available until Summer. I'm guessing as well that Breath of the Wild will also be getting delayed until Summer 2017 if this happens. If they launch BotW in March and people can't play it, they're just going to piss off their market base and poison the well leaving investors infuriated. If it's delayed until Summer 2017 though, I could see ports of Smash Bros. and Splatoon being ready for the launch, which would be cool and it would give considerably less hang time before the new Mario and Pokemon games that are supposedly coming next year. This is if Nintendo doesn't do their reveal until October of course. Maybe they're further along and more confident about their launch window than everything seems and we could still see a reveal this month, but it is looking considerably less likely now."

Instead, I find myself idolizing 'European' forms of government and fascism, rather than American individualism.

Therefore, although American, I find myself at odds with ""American values"". I drift more towards European nationalism. So what do you propose should be done about America? In what direction should it be taken? Should it be decentralized to be a collection of various cultures and city states? Should it be united under a fascist government? I really don't know what to do with it. Also, for the American nationalists here, what ""American"" values are you proud of?"

Being socially awkward at dinner parties isn't typically pervasive enough to be indicative of ASD, but there are also many ways it can show itself (inability to deal with change - especially in regards to plans, intense obsession with particular topics, difficulty comprehending how/why others feel a certain way [difficulty with empathy], feeling intense discomfort having close/intimate [not sexual/romantic] relationships with family or friends, etc) One of my brothers has a bit of Aspergers - not significant, but we picked up on it.

1,They're just trying to break you in for student loans.......,"This ticks me off as a mother. It is embarrassing to have this happen. It was embarrassing to me to be on free lunch growing up as a child especially when I got into Junior High and High School. In elementary it was not that embarrassing other than when all my classmates was getting ice cream because they could buy it while I went with out. Also, most of the time the students that actually paid for their food including those on reduce lunch got marked trays that meant they won a prize if they had that mark. One of my lunch ladies was very nice to me thought and purposely gave me that tray. I remember crying from being so happy to get that tray because for once I felt like I was like everyone else. This was just in elementary and boy was a I glad that we had to punch in a lunch code. In junior high it got worst because all of my friends was able to buy food for special windows where you can get pizza slices from Pizza Hut, foot long hot dogs, and etc. For the first two weeks in my Junior High I was able to as well because my free lunch had not kicked in yet since this was because I switched from a school in Cali to a school in Texas. My dad did not like the that fact because my sister was able to start school when school came back from winter break, but I had to wait a week because my transcript records got lost in the mail and than another two weeks before I could get free lunch which my sister got the first day she was in school. I felt so socially awkward as it was, but for once I felt like I was cool because I did not have that bloody free lunch. Then when my free lunch kicked in my dad stop giving me money and I went back to being one of the poor kids that got free lunch. I still had to punch in a code. In high school, I was not as embarrassed about the fact that I got free lunch because none of my friends that forced themselves onto me did not care and would even bring me back food from places close by school when they left to get their lunch. I felt awkward about accepting it, but they said I had to take it because they owe me for being the one that always listen to them without any judgement and suggesting great ideas to help them. I felt awkward because I was on free lunch and everyone knew it, but did not cared out of my high school. I think it was just from what I went through in Elementary and Junior High that made me feel that way. I also had a code in high school for my lunch. In all my schools if you did not have a bag lunch or money you had a code because you were on reduce or free lunch. I feel like what this school board is doing is totally wrong. It is shaming the students and despite them saying it is not meant to shame them, it is too so they will go home and tell their parents about how the lunch lady took there food because they are at a negative balance to get food. What happened to the saying ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you?"" How would the members of that school board feel if this happened to their children? Oh, wait, that is right. It does not effect there bloody offspring."

That doesn't mean that the rights themselves don't have value, or that the American concept of that value hasn't been successful in overcoming more autocratic systems of governance before, not just in terms of militaristic might but (call in naive if you will, but I think it's true) the strength of the ideal. America endures and bests tyranny. It's been empirically proven. But the way to demonstrate that is not to allow ourselves to become a more closed society in an attempt to protect that endurance, but to demonstrate that we MEAN it, even when it's challenged by ideas which seem anathema to it's existence."

1,Duterte got his insults from football ultras?,"A (sometimes) violent passion I really like football. I've been playing it for roughly 20 years myself, as an amateur, and I have followed the various European National leagues and the international turnaments since I was a kid. The club that I consider myself a fan of has probably the ""best"" and most passionate fans in the country I come from. But one thing that I cannot come to terms with is how violence and hateful feelings can accour between the fans of rivaling football clubs. I occasionaly go to watch a match at ""my"" team's stadium. But most times I don't really like being there due to how fans, by the hundreds, even thousands, are shouting insults and singing songs of hate directed at either the opposing team's fans or at the referee. Terms like ""son of a whore"" and ""cutting their [opposing team's fans] thoats"" does not belong in football, I think. Essentially, my question is really; why does anyone want to bring violence and hate to a sport that is probably the most popular in the World? How can anyone be so serious and ""passionate"" about a team that they want to actually HARM other people? Am I missing some sort of ""it's actually just for fun""-kind of agreement between fans or are these song a product of genuine hate?"

1,It's the Madden Curse.,"Has the League Become Anti-Odell? In only three years, OBJ has already had a career of incredible high's and low's. He went from being the league's darling and being shoved down opposing fans' throats so much that they got tired of him to being portrayed as a diva with an anger problem. Now sure, Odell does get a little too worked up at times and he does have to learn to keep his emotions in check in big situations but my god, NEVER has a player been baby'd by the league as much as he has been since the Carolina game. It's like he can't sneeze without getting flagged but DB's can tackle him out of bounds, go for his legs, bodyslam him, grab his facemask, and OBJ is expected to just take it all in stride. Keep in mind, Odell wasn't like this his rookie season, he had the same attitude as every other receiver and for being a top five player in his position straight out of college, he handled his stardom pretty well. Now, the Carolina game was 100% OBJ's fault and he has been punished for it. Keep in mind Norman was just as guilty as Odell and he was allowed to run his mouth all summer AND throw OBJ to the ground last Sunday with no suspensions. That's besides the point. The point is the league has gotten to the point of over-doing it with all these pre-game warnings and being trigger-happy with the flags. Is Burfict going to get warned before every game? What about Suh? Just fucking drop it already with trying to fix your mistake of not throwing them both out of the game last year before the whole thing got out of hand. The point is, instead of killing him for playing with some heart and passion, let OBJ play his game without treating him like the devil."
0,You can still have a crossfire with him not crossing the tunnel...,"His plan was to play from the other side of tunnels and he wanted to try that anyway and hoped that they wouldn't instantly peek it or even rush. That was a decision he had to make quickly not really a mistake. He called what he will do, the dude didn't listen and he did what he planned anyways. No way you can blame that on him. Also it is a pretty bad argument to say ""he could have played from the other side"" because that is simply not how it works. a 57 and an UMP + no crossfire or smoke to set up? The pros are not Gold Nova mate, they know exactly how the positions would be and that is why they instantly rushed in when they realized they will not smoke it off (even before dazed decided to actually challenge). One car + one side, no utility, no crossfire, that is a lost round right there and everybody should know that. That is just basic Counterstrike, you will not win a round with weapon disadvantage, no crossfire or any advantage created. That is why he called the strat, that is why he tried to establish a crossfire and that is why he decided to cross even without the smoke. There is not even room to argue here in my eyes."

0,"Other way around: L4 and L5 are stable for small perturbations, but L1, L2, and L3 are unstable, so an object occupying them will need to periodically boost to remain in place.","In total there are five La Grange points around each of the celestial objects. If you have ever produced a harmonic on a guitar string, that's a good way to think of it. When a harmonic is produced, if you look closely at the guitar string, you will see that the string is vibrating on either side of the harmonic node, but the node itself is seemingly very still. Just like the harmonics at frets 3, 5, 7 and 12 have very different characteristics, the La Grange points also have different properties. While you may be able to easily park a large object at L1 and rely on it staying there, parking the same object at L5 will mean you need to supply adjustments to the position every so often to stay there. What I found fascinating was the effect L1 had on the path of this object. An empty space exerting a gravitational pull on an object passing near it is mind blowing to me."

Now it's the end of October, my watch was only shipped last night and with taxes and shipping everything adds up to 132 $, while there are reports of Walmart already selling the Pebble 2 for 119 $ (that's probably without taxes?). So there was no benefit backing the Kickstarter project, or was there?

I currently live about 1200 miles away from the last ward I ever attended. That was in Logan, UT, and I now live in Minneapolis, MN. I think I was lucky that my exit from the church coincided with my (now ex) wife finishing college, since we moved to Seattle in 1998 (790 miles away), and just simply never went to church from that point forward. We never had to deal with people we knew asking us why we haven't been to church, nor did we endure the awkwardness of Mormon friends after leaving. Everything was new, and while TSCC did eventually find us and send home teachers on occasion, we always declined their invitation to return and even got some help with the yard work. Then we moved to Portugal (5200 miles) for 4 years, and during that time got divorced and I later met somebody from Minnesota. Together, she and I left Europe, moved to Seattle for 10 years (with zero Mormon contact), and have now been in Minneapolis for 6 months. It was after settling in Minneapolis that I finally resigned. TL;DR: I currently live about 1200 miles away from the last ward I ever attended. The furthest I've lived was 5200 miles."

0,Man I can just imagine the hell this rained down on your numbers for that day,"The first time I refused service. Today at twenty minutes until my long awaited lunch I called up my next customer in line. A girl approaches, she lets me know that she a lot of returns. Hey, that's no problem! I actually don't mind returns. I'm quite fast and efficient in getting them done and have never had any complaints. The girl proceeds to pull up a cart filled with stuff, and then with her fingers points me to glance into the direction of two more carts parked nearby, also absolutely filled to the brim with stuff. These items include complex home decorations, lamps, paintings, pillows, bedding, candles, shelf, bath accessories... etc... I mean all three carts are just bursting with bagged merchandise. Oh wow okay, this is going to be a big one. That's alright. I'm fine. I've done this before. I can do this. To my horror and dismay the girl tells me that she has no idea which receipts go with which purchase while holding out a bundle of about a hundred crinkled receipts in her hands... Now this is a problem. You see doing a huge amount of returns is only an issue for me when the customer have not managed to organize them beforehand. Nothing angers me more than a customer frantically searching for the proper receipt for their return while a long line keeps forming behind them.... I now explain to the girl that I will gladly help her out once she figures out all her receipts. She can place them around on the register next to mine and as soon she is finished I will do her returns and she will not have to wait back in line. She says to me, ""What do you mean? You will organize them with me. You have to help me find them. That's your job."" Now angered I explain to her that it's actually typical of the customer to have their receipts all ready for us before heading up to the registers, and that my job is actually cashing out customers and simply. And it would simply be unethical of me to just close up my register and only be of assistance to her. At this point we had a triple line up and I didn't give a fuck. Thankfully one of my coordinators was right behind and I quickly got her attention while information her of the situation and also reminding her of the fact that my break was coming up in twenty minutes and there was no way I would be finished with this customer in time. The coordinator agreed with me and she was upfront with the customer by saying that my presence was actually going to be needed on the registers today and that next time she does any returns it be a lot easier for everybody if they are already organized to begin with. Some other poor soul was taken from her department and made to assistant this customer with her returns. It was 11:00am when all this began, and I was told by the employee that it took until 2:30pm to finish up with that customer and all her returns. She had a bundle of about 60 receipts, $4000's worth of stuff, and no idea which items belonged on which receipts.... I have never refused service to a customer before and I am fucking glad that I did."

Alternatively they could build 100km of road linking the mine site with the nearest highway and then use that to get to the port. Think of it this way: A farmer who lives 20km from the market doesnt build a train line to get his produce there because he isnt moving enough for it to be efficient. This is a scenario where using trucks does not seem strange to us. These mines are using the same calculations but on a much larger scale.

(yeah i know the title says 19, i miswrote it lol) I have already worn braces (thanks god its over now!) , so my teeth are basically ""perfect"", except for one thing that makes me feel kind of depressed: they look yellowish. I have always had them like that, as long as I can remember. Last year, some of my classmates used to make jokes about them and i really felt like crap. I brush them after every meal, I seldom smoke and Im trying to cut down on coffee consumption: but idk I still see them yellow. My dentist told me that whitening strips and that stuff arent good for the teeth at all, so I am not buying that, I dont want to ruin them. I have noticed that they look yellower and thinner when the Sun is stronger... They look kinda dencent at night I guess. So, what can I do? Do you have any advice? I cant afford a teeth whitening right now, and my parents wont be willing to pay it. (PS: I dont want to ruin my enamel trying home made experiments)"

0,The lesson is: FUCKING VOTE,"I predicted it from talking to people. I'm Irish but spend a lot of time in the UK (I'm actually a dual national) I really got a feeling it was going to happen. The sentiment just seemed to be there. A lot of Brits I know would talk openly and honestly to me about it because they know I'm a bit of a nationalist, but they wouldn't feel comfortable talking to others about it because they were laughed at or ostracised. Same with strangers. The oul lads down the pub, the brickies or the bin men. People like that wanted out, but they'd never say it to anyone. I'm guessing there were a hell of a lot of people like that, and that's why the result was so contradictory to the opinion polls. Same as the Trump election. A lot of people wouldn't voice their views because they were demonised if they did, so they kept quiet until voting day, skewing the polls. And in both cases that's what caught people out. The leavers/trump supporters turned out in massive numbers because they are the people most likely to vote. The remainers/democrats thought they had it in the bag and didn't need to vote - because they believed the polls, which didn't tell the whole story. Either way, I don't believe you're fucked. You'll be grand. It won't be a ""hard brexit"", infact there's a decent chance it won't even happen - but what it will be is a kick in the arse for the EU to start listening to peoples concerns instead of ignoring them and living in a bubble. It could be what actually saves the EU, because the way it is going at the minute is like watching a train crash in slow motion."

I got a membership to this gym a few months ago after having only gone to PF and it's not what I was hoping it would be. Just a couple complaints I have that I'm wondering are legit enough to warrant a switch in gyms: * There's only one squat rack and there's always one person using it and one person waiting or working in with them. Lots of free weights, benches, and machines but as a beginner most programs focus heavily on the squat rack usage. * Parking is sometimes impossible. It's off of a highway and once the lot fills up you literally have nowhere to park so I have no choice * A big reason I signed up for the gym is because the manager showed me the massive stretching room. It's a big wood floored area with tons of bossu (spelling?) balls, mats, and foam rollers. What he didn't tell me is you can only use it when there isn't a womens class going on, which is almost never, so I don't actually get to use it and there's nowhere else to stretch and no mats or foam rollers outside the stretching room. * They segregate women and guys workout rooms. I don't have a problem with this but it means there are 10 times the amount of guys using half the gym so there's not a lot of equipment (like the squat racks) to go around. Was just wondering if any of these complaints are legit or just something I will deal with everywhere"

If you get the Gauss Rifle somewhat early on it annihilates everything in one shot. But at level 80, it takes multiple fully charged shots to the head to kill a **Gunner**. Then you look at the damage the Overseer's Guardian does, which is about half that of the Gauss Rifle, but it fires much faster, doesn't need a whole fucking second to charge up, and has much more common ammo. Therefore the Gauss rifle is absolutely useless. And a .50 Caliber Two Shot Sniper Rifle only does 30 or so more damage than the Overseer's Guardian, but isn't semi-auto, so not only does an Overseer's Guardian with .308 rounds beat out a motherfucking Gauss Rifle, it also beats out a .50 Two Shot Sniper Rifle.

1,Why focus on actual issues when we can call someone a sexist?,"You make some good points. And I totally agree that the 18yo scenario that you proposed sounds creepy, immature, and ""rapey"". Most of the comments that have gotten under my skin are when I see people saying that ""Trump brags about grabbing women by the pussy"". I think I might be guilty of associating that misleading statement with more valid complaints about what he said. I ended up listening to the clip again based on what you're saying and 100% don't like the way he talks about women in the clip. Here's what I ""hear"" in the tape when I listen: He told Bush that he failed when he tried to make a move on a married woman (cheating, yuk). He took her furniture shopping and didn't end up woo-ing her. Made some derogatory comments about her that are gross. He sees an attractive woman and eats some tic tacs, I presume because he doesn't want her to have a negative impression of his breath smelling and makes a joke about ""In case I kiss her"". Automatically attracted to beautiful women - guy talk. ""I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet.Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it."" This is the worst part I think. I think it's fair to assume he means ""I don't even wait [for permission?]"" but he doesn't actually say that, he could mean he doesn't wait to get home or to be in private. He also says that they ""let you do it [kiss them?]"" He's not saying he forces it if/when someone says no. In fact, he opened this tape up with saying how he ""failed"" to move in on the married woman. Then the next section is the ""You can do anything, [BUSH: Whatever you want?] Grab them by the pussy [BUSH:Laugh]. You can do anything."". Hyperbole, crude, inappropriate joke used to emphasize his point that as a star women let you do anything. Next, a few cat calls - pervy but guy talk. He then gets off the bus and *doesn't* automatically start kissing the attractive woman. Bush awkwardly proposes a hug for Donald and they hug/he kisses her on the cheek -- a ""family feud"" style interaction. The bottom line is that I don't approve of that conduct and it's not something I'd like to hear out of a 59 year old man let alone a presidential nominee. However, I think it's also really damaging to people's/the media's credibility to spin or exaggerate things at a time where the public trust of the media is already really damaged. I just wish that the media and Reddit would focus more on spreading information and letting people form their own opinions instead of twisting things and shaping perceptions. Well I am starting to regret posting my thoughts as it seems most people would rather not see them judging by the downvotes...but thanks for taking the time to make a good counter arguement."

0,You have wives that work in shifts?,"TIFU by playing GTA V with my 3 year old This was a few days ago. My son was down for his nap. My wife works 3rd shift, so she was a asleep. Figured I had an hour to play some Grand Theft Auto. Soon after, my son woke up and wanted to watch me play the game. I figured no harm for a few minutes, since I was just going to do races, or other non-violent things, with the sound off. Driving to wherever I was going, he yelled at me because I didn't stop for the red lights. I indulged him for a little bit until I got to one of the delivery missions that are timed. Didn't stop for the lights on that particular one. He became visibly upset on the verge of tears. I decided that it was probably best to stop playing. That's when the meltdown happened. It woke my wife up, so she's upset and can't go back to sleep. So I dealt with a grouchy wife and an inconsolable 3 year old that kept pointing out my driving mistake. Now my son notifies me of every light while we're actually driving and gives me directions on what to do. Every. Single. One. Yellow lights are the worst. TL;DR My son got upset because I didn't stop for the red lights in GTA V. A meltdown ensued and woke up my 3rd shift wife while she was trying to sleep from working the night before."

I relayed this information wrong, and said that the items on the top shelf were $1.00 and the items on the bottom shelf were $5.99. So the customers were like, yeah! We got them from the top shelf. So I asked my manager to repeat the information and I relayed the correct information to them about the pricing, as well as that I had gotten it wrong the first time with my apologies. That was when the customers started saying that they would go over there to check themselves with the manager but then the wife was like, ""No, the manager is probably right there right now, changing the signs so that when we get over there, we'll look dumb and wrong."""

This catches me off guard, and my first thought was I put the money on the wrong pump, so I ask ""I'm sorry, how much?"". ""... 6"" while giving me a look like I'm stupid. I then realize she means she wants 6 dollars on the pump, not 20 dollars on pump 6. Nearly everyone else says something along the lines of ""6 dollars on pump 6"".

This set (at least what's been spoiled so far) really just feels like 'black mana' - which is to say, it represents recklessness, sacrifice, oppression, criminal behavior, with a bit of murder and bad luck to boot. It's obviously black mana, but it's not so obnoxiously obvious and saturated. It feels right for a world where mana (aether) is strictly relegated and controlled, using machinery, and more importantly, it looks like it's giving us a set that just treats black differently than 'murder blood cult'. There's still a hundred cards to spoil, and any one of them could prove me wrong, but this is a pretty neat change of pace."

I am measuring this with a Tuner App in my phone. I am aware that moving the mouthpiece tunes the sax, but if I can play the G# without the body, it means that the mouthpiece is in the correct place... right? I played guitar as hobby.

Background: We're lesbians. Wife grew up in a really religious household. When she finally worked up the courage to come out of the closet, MIL was upset that she didn't consult her or seek her guidance before ""making her decision"". This was followed by months of her family sending her books about how being gay was wrong. After we started dating her mom would send her the occasional nasty email about how wrong the relationship was and she had no excuse because she was living in an area with plenty of attractive young men. We got engaged and again MIL cried and sent nasty emails and even tried to convince her society was just sending her confusing messages about her gender. She got every member of her family to send their personal message about how they didn't agree with the marriage and she should find a nice man instead. No one in her family showed up to the wedding. Her extended family on both sides seem normal tho. Even GMIL seems happy to see me we visit. Anyways, we have started the process to have children and I'm not looking forward to dealing with MIL's shit. I have had to hold my wife through too many tears because of her shitty emails. I know she's going to play favoritism if we both go through pregnancy. I know any baby I carry will be dismissed by her and they'll view my wife's bio kid as being born out of wedlock. So I joined this sub so i have a place to vent when the inevitable shit show starts in a few weeks when we make our announcement."

They'll try to rile up the people by saying that the government is trying to reduce the number of people who are a majority (via religion / caste / something else). You could then say: maybe the central government should do this instead. In that way all of India will be affected, so they cant use the same tactic. Answer to that is, that it still wouldn't work at all. The problem is that, most states are already in green territory in terms of birth rates (A few are reaching really low counts: example state of Kerala).

We're already building a series of barriers and flood prevention measures around downtown Manhattan and up the east and west sides to, roughly, midtown. But it's $335 million just to start that, and a couple billion to finish. But that's just lower Manhattan. To fully protect the all the vulnerable parts of the five boros will take billions and billions, and given our current useless governor and a Congress whose only goal is to give as much money to corporations and rich people as possible, where's the money coming from? Cuomo can't even fund the MTA because he's got to give billions for upstate highways no one wants, or needs. He could give a fuck about anything which doesn't lead him to a presidential nomination. Additionally, there will be considerable NIMBY pushback. Adapting to these changes will require some people to face some tough relocation choices, as there are parts of the shoreline on Staten Island and Long Island which will be too flood prone for any permanent structures, but people will demand to live there anyway. There are also issues around economic justice. After downtown Manhattan is protected, the obvious next areas to work on will be low lying areas of Staten Island and Brooklyn and Queens. But I will bet you a month's rent that when the next phase is in the planning stages, it's the Upper East and West sides of Manhattan which will be fighting the hardest for the funding, because rich people. So, yeah, the same thing will happen here. Shouldn't take more than a couple weeks."
1,Soon as mason costs them a grand final berth than he will be steppin in those shoes,"Is Mason Cox the next Jim Stynes? I draw comparison between Mason Cox and Jim Stynes. When Stynes first played for Melbourne in the 1980's, his own teammates were quick to let him know he wasn't wanted; a gimmick rather than a true footballer. Gary Lyon once said that he was angry an Irishman with no background in the AFL was playing in the major league. Jim Stynes himself said he felt unsure his first years in Australia and battled criticism from fans and media alike. His first few years in the game were woeful. However, it was Jim Stynes character that would ultimately lead to his success to becoming a Brownlow medalist. That same character that had people admire him outside of football post career. Every interview or opinion piece I can find on Mason Cox is that he is a dedicated, hard working and committed person with those same attributes that Stynes possesses. The difference is, Cox has had a better start to his playing career than Stynes did. He is also loved by the fans at Collingwood, and outside of the club alike."

Anyway I would love to see WW2 next, especially on current gen. It would also be really interesting to see the transistion from WW1 to WW2. It would make WW2 feel modern compared to WW1. Don't get me wrong, I'm hugely excited for BF1, but I'd love to see WW2 next."

I cancelled my back when I realised I had the last hit but was completely unable to pickup the orb, nor was the Rampage on my team (and nobody on the enemy team could either).

0,If I wanted to play a generic MOBA I would play LoL or Smite instead.,"Three Reasons I think the OP Change Is Good for Paragon In case you haven't seen it, in V.32, the Orb Prime buff is now instantly granted to the team that kills the Prime Guardian. This means no more defensive dunks, no more carrying the orb and running for your life from the enemy team. I understand why people might be skeptical, but here are three reasons I think it's a good change. **1. Shorter matches for everyone** With defensive dunking removed, inhibitors are now priceless and losing one will likely be the writing on the wall for the losing team. That means winning your lane is more decisive over the course of a match. We have all been in those games where the two teams are so evenly matched they restore inhibitors several times only to extend the game for more than an hour. That mechanic is now gone. **2. Orb Prime is a risky play due to the Travel Mode speed reduction** In the past when a team wanted OP they would push their minion waves a little bit and then run over to the OP to take it down. When you were in danger of losing a tower it was no problem to rotate one or two players over to defend. Travel mode was reduced by 150 movement speed, which means an undefended lane will be undefended for much longer than before. If you abandon your lanes you risk losing towers, no way around it. This means teams will have to be more intentional about who stays to defend and who goes to attack prime. It is actually *more* in favor of tactical teams. **3. Stealing OP is much more viable** Now if you snipe OP from the shadow pool your whole team gets the buff no matter where they are. Even if you get the last hit and you are Steel, Murdock, Gideon womboed to death, your work is done and your team are on their way to at least one objective kill. I would argue that this creates *more* counterplay than when you had to chase the orb carrier through the jungle. Especially since if he had a head start there was nothing you could do. **Please discuss.** I love this game like the rest of you and we know nothing is set in stone. We will see how it plays out, but I'm very interested to know your thoughts. As always glhf."

As a politician trying to get reelected, the best way to continue to get elected is to try to manipulate emotions, as they are much more easily manipulated than, well facts. Once someone has tied an emotion to a belief, they will often continue to hold that belief even if presented with contradicting evidence...which is good for someone trying to get reelected.

They claim the universe and existence itself, which we are part of, is 'god'. As an atheist I think of god as a supernatural deity that can bend the rules of the universe to his will. Since there is no evidence of this, it can be dismissed without evidence. But Pantheists assert that existence itself is god. The problem I have with this proof is, it doesn't tell me anything. It takes the word god and applies it to a the natural world. Well I believe in the natural world, and I'll assert most atheists probably do as well. The difference between an atheist and a pantheist is atheists are not so ashamed to call themselves atheists that they need to be intellectually dishonest about what words actually mean. If the natural world exists as it would without a god, then why call it god?"

Turning to modern politics, the second most prosperous and materially blessed nation in my lifetime may be the Chinese. This blessing almost certainly isn't the result of faithfulness to the Gospel. How are these men--many of whom are Godly men who have far more scriptural training than I do--so certain that America has received a special blessing?"

Meanwhile, I've sent countless apps through company websites without hearing a peep. And it's such a seamless process compared to the fuckery that is most company website applications. LinkedIn gets a lot of flak for being the dorky second cousin of social media that nobody likes, but if applying through them became the norm for the hiring process, it would be a huge improvement. Just make sure your LinkedIn profile is as sharp as you can get it. Professional headshot or other nice photo, max out the ""skills"" section, get endorsements from former supervisors if you can."

They admit that they like the premise, the animation, even the story, it's just the fanservice and tropes and to an extent the unrealistic plot can put them off.

1,So are wild bears or alligators being nice to cats to keep their human owner not upset?,"Absolutely. The way it's moving timidly shows that it's been attacked by the cat before and fears being attacked again. If the owners let the cat attack the dog to the point it's that timid, it's on them that the dog is so afraid of the cat. People are prone to letting cats screw with dogs with no real ramifications to the cat because it makes for funny videos like this. But any dog and cat owner that lets this kind of dynamic happen in their house is fooling themselves if they think a dog wouldn't be able to wreck the cat's day if it was pushed hard enough. Dogs were bred to hunt, herd, and kill. I mean I've got no beef with people letting their dogs and cats interact this way. I'm not trying to say the owners of the pets in the OP are bad at all. I think stuff like this is hilarious. Just saying that there's a dynamic behind it but if the owners weren't in the picture and this was two stray/feral animals, that cat would be dead."

1,"Plus the toxic community see the replies Better just leave no sarcasm oh wait edit,","Uninstalled a month ago And haven't been tempted to play since. Dota 2 is fun, but for me there are a few huge issues: - The individual player does not have enough control over the game outcome. If you are head and shoulders above your MMR then you can consistently solo carry, but for most of us you are going to lose 35-40% of your matches based on your teammates being shit. It's not fun to be a passenger. - The games are too long. The only other game I've regularly played in the past two years is FIFA. Matches last about 20 minutes. It's long enough to be engaging and immersive, but not so long that it eats up all of your time. On the other hand, the average Dota 2 game is like 50+ minutes when you account for searching + drafting. And if you chase losses in a bad session, you can melt away 3-4 hours in the blink of an eye, and still feel totally dissatisfied. Downvote and ""git gud"" if you want. Just thought I'd share my experience walking away. I'll probably still watch pro Dota 2 when the next major is up. I really enjoy the esport aspect of Dota. However, I don't enjoy the game itself that much though."

Politician A claims this, Politician B claims that, and who's right is for YOU to decide. This seems to be good journalism, right? The problem is that the media has gotten so used to presenting both sides that they won't point out when one side is absolutely, unequivocally incorrect. That's why people hate this chyron. CNN is, by habit, neutrally presenting the fact ""Alt-Right founder questions if Jews are people"" so that YOU can decide on the validity of the issue. But Jewish people are obviously people, so CNN should have run a chyron like ""Alt-Right founder on record as anti-semitic"". It might seem like a minor difference, but this is standing out to people as an example of how little broadcast media has learned over the past few months."

You guys call it a marriage, or refraction but the fact remains that no matter where you are or how high you go all you ever see is a flat horizon, you never see curvature. Ever.

0,I think with the new structure of the tournament and the number of limited seating this rule no longer applies but we won't know until a team actually tries it,"The worst thing is that any top 4 NA/EU team can play in OGN if they want to, (ogn has stated that they'd give a free spot to any teams that want to play there from another region), so TSM, C9, FNC etc can easily get a spot at OGN and actually get good practice and results will show in a year or two, but they don't want that because then they wouldn't be able to stay in touch with their fans and the brand would eventually die out (a risk for it). So it's most likely bs when they say ""I want to win worlds, it's the most important thing to me."" CLG did it, and because of that TSM gained more fans during the period CLG was in Korea, props to them though to actually taking a step forward in 2012 or smth, but people wont do it again because it's a bad business move."

0,you didnt mention arcane bullshitma,"Rose has no stuns. She has a movement restricting debuff where you can still shoot while she still does lower DPS than you so technically it's still your fault for not killing her before she kills you. Goatify is a true disable but unless she uses it against you at point blank you should be able to hide before she kills you. Now before you say anything, I do not claim that Rose is easy to deal with. She is a MASSIVE bitch at the right hands, and I admit I have a lot of trouble dealing with good Rose players. At least I, even though I main her, admit that she ridiculously powerful and she can cause too many problems. I don't go on forums telling people that I can kill her for free and that her small hurtbox is no issue for my godlike aim, while at the same time ranting for her to be removed from the game. I hope you know what I mean."

0,How did you randomly become a troll,"How I would book Curtis Axel (The New Perfect One) So Curtis Axel has been poorly booked for years now, and one thing that WWE always seems to shy away from is that his father is Mr. Perfect. So why don't they repackage that gimmick and let Axel run with it. he comes out and cuts a very believable ""draws the line between reality and facade"" promo, talking about how his father had always wanted him to be a success in this business, and how he has been under utilized as a superstar, claiming that he is done being a disappointment and that he is demanding the respect he is entitled to, referring to himself as the ""perfect"" and ""ideal"" superstar multiple times. Stephanie and Mick foley come out and ask him to calm down, he refuses so they book him in a match. They state multiple times that this is a match he should lose, because this guy is the next big thing, hinting at the fact that the match was supposed to be a squash. (Further blurring the lines between facade and reality). The match begins, It's Axel against a younger guy, someone like Sami Zayn who needs the push. The match is filled with Axel noselling all of Zayn's moves, and Zayn clearly becoming frustrated. Then out of nowhere Axel explodes, just overhaul attacking Zayn, but it looks so sporadic and random that it seems like it is actually real. Real security comes out, no music is played, and the referee gives the ""X"" signal on his arms after checking on Zayn. This is Axel's attitude from here on out. He would go out there and actually attack his opponents. To the point where he is nearly fired from the business. But he comes to an on screen bargain, where he gets creative leniency, and he takes full advantage of that. One week later he is in the ring as The Perfect, Curtis Axel. He is up against US Champion Sami Zayn (See my last post). And he easily goes over. He gives himself a match for the Universal Championship, against Kevin Owens, and forces Owens to tap out to a handshake. It gets to a ridiculous level to where he is holding the Universal, US, and Tag Team Championships himself, with no partner. Then one day while cutting a promo about being perfect, an intro song hits, nobody knows who it is until the superstar comes out, or superstars. Out come Broken Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy, armed with a creative leniency contract, and they challenge Axel to a match. A match that they make up on the spot, called the better bookers match, where they are faced with challenges on who to book as a great superstar, and how. If Axel wins, he gets full creative control, if Hardy wins, creative goes back to the actual staff, and Axel must vacate his titles. We only see the results of each booking, played out in the ring in front of us. As each person reads off what they wrote, the events happen, with the actual superstars following suit in ring. The a twitter poll is held and that is how the winner is determined. It is a best of 7 series of course, and it consists of How To Book: Neville, Samoa Joe, Braun Strowman, Cesaro and Sheamus, Sin Cara, and Chris Jericho. Hardy wins in a 5-4 victory."

Similarly, do you spend stardust on currently strong Pokemon knowing they could very well be nerfed in the near future. I think the theoretical best strategy would be to collect high CP mons of all types without powering anyone up. And then in ~3-6 months once the game stabilizes a bit more (fingers crossed) decide which 'mons you are going to max out. But that is also not any fun, so no one should realistically do that.

1,No I wouldn't,"Would you still watch the NFL if it wasn't the #1 sport in America? I still have a lot of fun watching hockey even though it is only the 4th most popular sport. I sometimes lie to myself that not having the widespread interest in hockey of other Americans doesn't impact my overall fandom experience but it kinda does. Do you think you would still be interested in football if it was a much much less popular sport? No games on major broadcast networks, gotta pay for expensive sports packages or watch shitty streams. Get bewildered or dirty looks when you ask the bartender to put your team's game on one of the TVs. Have less of a fanbase to connect with and enjoy camraderie. ESPN won't dedicate *any* time during SC to cover your sport. How would you feel if the NFL was way lower in the sports hierarchy in America?"

0,I wish I had as good taste as you in high school.,"This is basically the album that got me through high school. Any time I listen to it it brings me back to being 17 and walking/driving around in the snow during the winter, contemplating existence and other angtsy teenager things. There's such a distinctive atmosphere to this record - I can only really listen to it during late fall and winter. A lot of people dismiss Brand New because of their ties to the emo/punk-pop movement of the early 2000's, but this album (as well as Daisy and Deja) still holds up excellently IMO. Its aged very well, and it doesn't have the same ""woe is me, life sucks, my girlfriend left me, etc"" feeling of other albums from the genre. The things Jesse Lacey frets about here are entirely real struggles that many people face when transitioning into adulthood and the ""real world,"" and its a definite departure from the genre's typical lyrical themes. TDAG shows a lot more indie/alternative influence than punk/emo. Luca sounds like something Thom Yorke could've written. Jesus Christ sounds straight off of The Moon and Antarctica. This is one of the only albums I loved during my angsty teen phase that still holds up today. Limousine and Handcuffs can still turn me into an emotional wreck. Sowing Season and Not the Sun still get me headbanging. Degausser and You Won't Know still melt my face off. This album is in essence the documentary of someone losing their faith, realizing the world isn't the idealistic and pure place they were led to believe, growing apart from their loved ones/friends, and coming to terms with the fact that the world can be a terrifying/unsettling place that we're all forced to face on our own in the end. I don't listen to Brand New nearly as much as I used to, but I still love this album and it's without a doubt my favorite by them. The experimentation and dark themes really set this album apart from its peers. I'd consider it the OK Computer of emo."

1,"I find the term ""meat shop"" very offensive","I find this new generation quite amusing. Its empowering if women find a sugar daddy and use their bodies to achieve their goals but if a man makes a comment about it we go into a fit of rage? Trump is an idiot, lets just get that out of the way. But what he said about women isn't entirely false. Women do tend to allow men with money to do as they please in exchange for material goods that they have been programmed to want since they were little girls. There is websites that allow for the arrangement of Men seeking women that could be their daughters to exchange sex for ""gifts"" and everyone somehow labels it as different from prostitution or escorting, I guess because they are pretending to have feelings for this man old enough to be their father? Look at Trumps wife, now take away his money and power, do you still see her in the picture? Probably not. Why are women not held responsible for their actions? Dan Bilzerian (forget your perception about him for a moment) Posted a photo immediately following this of him grabbing a woman's vagina and posted it to his millions of followers. As she stands there smiling in her bikini does anyone ever consider the influence that she has on young girls that see these images?

The US had no titles since Kenny Roberts Jr, no home GP, and a single GP rider that wasn't doing so well.

A person of mixed ethnic heritage raised on a Native American Reservation. Believe me when I tell you that there is no love lost between Trump and myself. I didn't vote for a single republican this election. However, the response of my democratic party to the election defeat is even more depressing to me than the victory of Trump. Liberalism begins and ends with freedom of thought and freedom of speech. Everything else we believe flows from these two things. I just watched Hillary calling for government and corporate intervention to censure ""fake news"". It leaves me feeling nauseous. Like there is no where left to go politically. We did not loose this election because of nut jobs writing hit pieces on the internet, and truth be told, our leftists match them hit piece for hit piece. We did not loose this election because of some tidal wave of white supremacists. We lost this election because my party put forward the most corrupt political family since LBJ pilled up his hundreds of millions in bribes. We put forward and utterly corrupt minion of the corporate establishment, and the American people handed us our heads. The Clintons passed Nafta and passed the banking ""reform"" laws. Which taken together, shipped 86,000 factories and 40% of our manufacturing jobs to China and Mexico. They took these actions and were then paid billions by their corporate masters who profited by this. When the dispossessed workers came out in mass and voted against her in response this was not an act of white supremacy, nor a response to fake news. It was a last desperate gamble by the working and middle classes to make the establishment listen to them. If we democrats don't wake up and smell the coffee, and start listening to the working class we used to represent, if we don't stop insulting them and denigrating them, we are going to hand this country to the republicans for the next fifty years. If we seriously try to pass censureship in the wake of our loss we will loose the rank and file American voter for at least a generation."

So I got a talking to about how I shouldn't be 'bullying' the only girl in the office. Keep in mind, the conversation I had with her was completely civil and an attempt at explaining all sides of the situation to her. I didn't harass her for actions. I only kindly explained how, in the back room it gets much hotter with all the machines and especially when people are moving around, carrying stuff while working. So although her little office may get colder, and if she's sitting down/not moving around it will even feel colder to her. It's better if we use the a/c to accommodate as many people as possible, and it's a bit easier for her to wear a sweater than for the others to find a way to stay cool with the heater on. But yeah, I'm the bully. I was also backhandedly called sexist at one point for suggesting that she shouldn't be allowed to work in the production room as they would sometimes have her do when we were short handed. My reasoning being that she said herself she wasn't strong enough to lift the boxes and bringing a dolly into the small production room was a risk to other employees safety because they would trip on it constantly and she wasnt even strong enough to manuever it in a safe manner. She would lay the dolly flat and push it like a sled....backwards. But ""women survive child birth so we are stronger in other ways than men."" Was the response I got from the owner. I'm still not sure how that was relevant. The owner also told me she paid her a bit extra hourly because she ""has to deal with all the boys in the office."" It went over her head when I tried to explain that maybe she should keep that information to herself because it's pretty sexist."

Many of the apostles were single, Christ Himself was single - and isn't He the gold standard for any christian life? You have to acknowledge as a Christian, though, that everyone has a different calling - we are many parts but all one body - so there's not going to be any one-size-fits-all social construct for everyone's talents or spiritual gifts or calling. Some are called to be married and have a family, others aren't."

1,[The Chiss companion from DvL has comments on Kira apparently so make sure you hit eternal tier for the event.],Question Jedi Knight and Companions in KotFE I played the first nine chapters of the expansion last year and a few days ago I started playing again mainly because of the upcoming KotET. I'm at chapter 14 now and a lot of companions I know from other classes are coming back but there is still no sign of any Jedi Knight companion. Will the chapters 14-16 provide me with any of them? This is definitely my biggest gripe with the expansion. I know you can get them back via the terminal but they don't interact with you. I love some of the new companions like Lana or Senya but I want my Kira and Scourge back. Have her interact with the others. This seems so weird since KotFE is basically the continuation of the Jedi Knights story instead we get a Trooper companion like Jorgan. And by the way. Where the hell is Elara Dorne!? Granted I haven't finished the Trooper story yet but I expected her when I saw Jorgan. Well way to much text. Tl;dr: Will companions of the Jedi Knight show up in the chapters 14-16?

1,i like how you turned the focus from israel to 'the jews',"Is there Evidence of Israeli Involvement in 9/11 There is extensive evidence of intelligence chatter pre-9/11. Even Saddam Hussein was asked about what he knew of a planned terrorist attack in June. There were many zionists in the Bush administration. There are many zionists in Obama's admin. Apart from the dancing Israelis and the proximity of zionists, what evidence is there that Israel of ""the jews"" did it? From the dancing Israelis, if there was chatter and it became obvious that the US was killing all attempts to stop the attack, then why wouldn't they be filming it? It seems clear that it wasn't Israel: Israel couldn't call off the interception of planes, wire the buildings, call off the investigation, call off the FBI, issue the visas, etc. If there is an investigation, it will never focus on Israel. Saying it was ""the jews"" is a way to be dismissed. It was the neocons. Did they get Israeli assistance? That is why we need an investigation: to see who else was involved. Talking about ""the jews"" is not a way to get an investigation. Please present evidence that it was not the neocons, but Israel or please stop allowing people to dismiss an investigation into 9/11 because of your disinfo. I will be using this post to address people who make threads about ""the jews"" and 9/11, so downvote all you like. I don't care if this thread itself gets attention: it's a tool to address disinfo."

0,Stb1 is the most modern i think the chieftain entered service in 66 the stb was developed into 68/69,"If you're looking for vehicles from Armored Warfare appearing in WoT, it is unlikely. What WoT calls Tier 8-10, AW calls Tier 1-3. AW didn't bother with WoT's ""paper/theoretical/fantasy tank"" meta to fill out trees. AW mixes nationalities, depending on when a vehicle was produced and how it compares to others of that type. I'm generalizing here, of course. Because post-war tanks are more powerful than WWII tanks, they'd have to go beyond Tier 10. Assuming they can find enough vehicles to fill all those spaces. I think the Chieftain Mk 6, Tier X British Heavy, is the newest vehicle (in RL, late-1960s or 1970s) in WoT. It's not designed to be a rolling bunker like other Tier X HTs. It's a modern Main Battle Tank. As far as modern tanks go, with the Chieftain, we have the T-54 and T62A, which have been produced in the late 1950s and upgraded through the 1970s. Ditto with the Patton line of tanks on the American side. I don't think we'll see tanks much newer than circa 1960 in WoT. We certainly won't see the M1 Abrams and T-80 in WoT."

1,Yes it's good old fashioned Christian family values that these folk are lacking,"It cannot be ignored that a big reason why they end up in such desperate economic situations is because there is little to no emphasis on important ideals such as family and education. If the fathers stuck around and the families stayed together, the children would receive the familial support they need to ensure they stay in school, receive a good education, and become a contributing member of society. If this were the norm instead of the exception, much of this strife would dissipate. Instead we're left with an endless cycle of broken homes, lack of education, and crime."

Maybe there is a better phone somewhere out there, but I actually don't give a fuck since I found one that suits me for a very good price. It's a great upgrade even though my old iPhone was more expensive. Also, be prepared to have to customize more things by yourself.

1,"Damn, you missed out at looking at the night sky while on heroin.","I know! This is crazy! I remember thinking my whole life that the pictures of the milky way are all digitally created to be more vibrant and the sky doesnt ACTUALLY look like that... Then one weekend I went to Sandbanks National Park (Ontario), and when night fell I still didnt really notice (we were encased in trees). Someone made me laugh so hard I threw my head back in laughter, and immediately gasped and covered my mouth at the sight of the beautiful sky and the milky way. I've only ever seen it once and it wasnt nearly as colorful as some of the pictures I see on r/EarthPorn, but I remember being in so much awe that I ran down to the beach to just lay in the sand for hours staring at the night sky. Then some creepy guy tried to sell me heroin and I left, he ruined the whole thing. But 9/10 would go again. That sky is beautiful."
