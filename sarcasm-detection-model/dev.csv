0,I don't see any problem here.,"Sex is painful for both me (top) and my boyfriend ( bottom) Me and my boyfriend have been together for quite a while and are finding sex very difficult. Some background I'm 24 and a top and my boyfriend is 22 and a bottom, we're both experienced sexually and have both been sexually active since our early teenage years but since we got together we've had problems chiefly to do with insertion and pain for both of us my boyfriend has commented several times that I am the most well endowed partner he's had especially in thickness ( around 6"" in circumference) and has complained of pain during initial insertion and a burning sensation during re-insertion if my penis comes out of him, and I have been experiencing pressure on my penis during sex, this can range from pleasant to sometimes painful enough that I lose my erection and can remain sore for some time after we have finished. We have tried experimenting with various positions and tried using both water based gel lubricant and a silicone based lubricant ( both from the durex brand ) Admittedly the more we attempt to have sex we have been increasingly successful and my boyfriend has began using a series of incrementally size increasing butt plugs and dildos in order to be used to accomodating my larger penis. I understand that this may just be a case of practice makes perfect but I'm just looking for any advice that may help us with our problem as we have a wonderful relationship and love each other deeply and want to have a good healthy sex life together."

0,When do sign ups open?,it will start in Jan after we get through the holiday season. I don't see the point in starting and then taking 100 breaks to get through 1 season with vacations family time and everything else. As far as Roster swapping that will be 100% on a situation by situation. 1. There will need to be a legitimate reason and 2. the swap must maintain the balance within the league itself. The one gaurentee is that i will fight to keep the teams as balanced and competitive as possible through out the season with sub choices (when needed) and filling vacated slots. While people are saying the skill difference between the bronze and gold aspect of the game is big i personally believe the skill difference between P5 and D1 is even larger. There is a plan in place to balance both leagues as closely as possible and we will attempt to moderate and maintain that balancing throughout the season. If and I mean if this appears to be a problem throughout the first season of them running this way then adjustments will be made to better fit the community come the next season start.

0,I wonder if he could tweak the trajectory and speed based on the players speed?,"First off, you are doing an AMAZING job with this mod.

Question; for the pass feature (default down on the d pad,) is it possible to make it lead you a bit more, especially when going slower. While it still works great, a little tweak to the trajectory would help it be more of a lead pass. As it is now, it leads you a little bit, but not quite enough. I'm not sure how difficult this is to change, but if it is possible, it is something that you could consider changing. But even if it is not changed, I very much appreciate how much work you have put into this mod.

I think this is evident with the performance of the Democratic Party since he was elected to office. In 2010 the Democrats lost 63 house seats, and completely lost control of the House and Senate in 2014. Democrats have lost 15 state legislatures since Obama's first term and at least 11 governorships. Obama himself has relied on a heavy use of executive orders, jailing or at the least intimidation of whistle blowers, execution of American citizens without legal review, and implementation of treaties without Senate consent."

It cracks me up that people seem to think the world's leading economists have never had the thought, 'let's just implement tariffs and make imports so expensive companies are motivated to make them here'. Forgetting that there would be enormous consequences beginning with tariffs being immediately slapped on our exports making them far less appealing to the world market. If you enjoy $200 42 in HD TVs and under $100 Kindles etc... kiss those goodbyes. Not only that, assuming that we could bring back every lost manufacturing job somehow, it would take a decade for the US to build the infrastructure and manufacturing facilities necessary to even begin to match China and the rest of the world's manufacturing power combined. If we pull those levers it's not like countries not named China aren't going to step in and immediately fill their place. We live in a globalized economy. Even it were the prudent and intelligent thing to do there is no way to undo it at this point that would not result in enormous short and intermediate term pain for the economy and country. There is **plenty** of wealth being generated, that is not the problem, the problem is in how it's distributed. Everything Trump wants to do in that space would simply compound the problems."

Bear in mind none of the white residents in the article saw anything ""racial"" about the remark. That may be why no one ever admits to being racist: actual racists are really bad at self-identifying because their views are never racist."

0,Android TV now allows formatting external drives as internal storage so Plex will use that.,"Plex Media Server on 16gb shield Xpost from the AndroidShieldTV subreddit for more visibility/opinions. Can anyone give me a definitive answer on this question please? I'm seeing some conflicting viewpoints, so I just want to have it clarified. I'm considering picking up a shield to serve as a media device for my television downstairs. I've already got a Plex server up and running on my desktop PC, but I was considering moving it to a shield device so that I could have it always on, without the power draw that a desktop PC has. I've seen two different takes on this. Some people say that you have to get the 500gb model to run a Plex server, because Plex can only store metadata or something on the internal storage. The counterpoint is that an SD card or external drive can apparently be specified as internal storage, thereby increasing the capacity of the shield. Does Plex take advantage of this extra ""internal"" storage for PMS duties? Or will I still have to turn off thumbnails and take a performance hit of some sort? Just to clarify, all my media will be stored on my NAS, not on the shield. Thanks!"

0,How is using the bathroom the same as killing people or abducting people?,"Legally defining bathroom use is not discrimination. That would be like saying that homicide laws are discriminatory because black people commit the most homicides - it makes no sense. Or if blue aliens abducted the most people, and abduction happened to be illegal, are we discriminating against blue aliens? What it comes down to is whether or not it is legally defensible to segregate bathrooms. Obviously religious people especially want segregated bathrooms, but this also impacts all levels including school gyms. If you cannot legally defend or enforce gender segregation in bathrooms, the end result is non-segregated bathrooms and showers everywhere to prevent ""discrimination"" lawsuits. Which, further, means an inevitable rise in lawsuits regarding misconduct. This isn't about rape, and I don't care if some Republican or other claimed it was. It's a red herring, and shame on you for slapping people with it. The real issue, in the end, is whether or not ANYONE will EVER be allowed to have gender secluded facilities. But hey, don't let reality stop the circlejerk train. Obviously I just hate trans people."

1,Ugh... if you love public radio so much why don't you just marry it... Turrible post :P,"The End of The Edge: finding something new on the radio The Edge is gone and as I've seen multiple posts point out, the mainstream radio in the area keeps becoming more and more homogeneous, making it hard to find anything other than top 40 and ""adult contemporary"" on our dials. I know I'm super late to the party here, and I keep seeing these stations come upon comments, but I haven't caught a post mentioning them together. Sooo... We have some really solid public radio in North Texas, and over the last year or so it's become just about all I listen to. None of them are direct replacements for KDGE, but I had personally been more and more disappointed in what was being played anyway. 91.7 KXT is an outstanding music station that plays long sets with little interruption and huge variety. One of their big bragging rights is that they play, at minimum, one local band every hour. They play from a wide range of styles, but you mostly hear a variety of rock and indie music. You may tune in to something that's not your thing, but more often than not when it happens to me it's something I haven't really heard before. At that rate I'd rather listen to something I don't like so much and then be aware of something new than hear a song I don't love or hate for the thousandth time. 89.3 KNON is a long running public station that's mostly music, but does run in an old school ""program"" format. So you may tune in to something that just isn't you at one time slot, but if you check in at different times, even different days, you'll start noticing the programs that you do and don't like. They do a blues show in the early evenings that's solid and ranges from scratchy old recordings from way back to current blues acts from around the country, usually really good stuff. Also, every Thursday from 8 PM - 12 AM Hard Time Radio is on, which is real heavy metal and hard rock, like REAL heavy, it's one of my favorite things on the radio right now, if for no other reason than it's different from anything else on the air. They are in the middle of a pledge drive right now, so especially if you're into metal or rock, it's a great time to check it out and think about supporting something unique. 90.1 KERA is the well known public talk radio for NTX and is an affiliate of NPR/PBS. It is basically all talk. If you enjoy talk radio shows, but find the snarky conversations and commentary on a lot of the commuter slot shows to be a little much, it's definitely worth checking out. I have always found the shows to have a good blend of information and entertainment, and most of the time they do a good job of including a wide variety of opinions represented by guests if not hosts. If nothing else, the beauty of public radio is that it's mostly listener supported, and while you certainly catch the occasional pledge drive, you'll hear virtually no commercials through most of the year. 102.1 as we know it ultimately went of the air because the corporation that owns it sees a better opportunity to profit from the channel and that's the business they're in. Most of the comments I've read have been to the effect that people are sorry to see it go, but haven't really enjoyed it all that much for the last few years anyway, and that's exactly how I feel. With public broadcast, support dictates programming, so if there's something you're glad is on the air, you can personally have a hand in keeping it there. TLDR; listen to public radio. 91.7, 89.3, and 90.1 are all awesome in different ways."

We live about 10 minutes apart, had been best friends for a few years in college and post, but she essentially ghosted me after beginning a new relationship. I've tried to get together many times with her, sometimes she doesn't even respond. I'm surprised I was even invited since it seems like she doesn't care about our friendship anymore. TL;DR ghosted by friend, should I go to her wedding?"

0,Try looking at Chomsky Philosophy on YouTube.,"Talk on U.S. foreign aid? I remember watching a long talk by Chomsky about U.S. foreign aid; specifically about: * How most people imagine it to be much greater than it actually is. * How it is generally less than a lot of other industrialized countries offer. * How most people imagine it to be charitable, when in fact it is mostly military, and the rest is mostly to subsidize U.S. companies as they exploit populations by driving out local business and taking advantage of the resulting devalued labor and increased demand for products. * How Mexico, specifically, has essentially been propping up the U.S. economy, rather than the other way around. * How the biggest recipients are Israel and Egypt, and other brutal states like Saudi Arabia and Turkey also receive large amounts. I cannot find the video of this now. Can anybody please point me in the right direction? Appreciate any help!"

0,"It wont fix anything, but the PMM got an ammo buff in the next patch.","I really think a way to make Fuze a better pick is to re-work his model to be slightly smaller (he's huge in-game) and make him a 2-speed. Which would allow him to rotate properly, because like you said, he's a one shot operator regarding direction of attack. They could just treat him and his shield like the recruit at that point. 2/2 normally, and a 2/1 with shield. IMO I personally find that he's the weakest shield Op as well, having no abilities tied to it his only saving grace is the powerful PMM and the fast reload. But there's a distinct lack of ammo if it's the main weapon, and again, his model is almost too large for the shield to protect. I'm at a loss because I like his AK, but he's as wide as a doorway and very slow. Aside: It's strange how they made all the Spetnaz Ops very slow and clunky when irl they have a reputation for being very quick, decisive and brutal."

0,AUPitch has separate dials for pitch and speed :),"Changing Pitch while Maintaining Tempo/Quality in Logic Impossible?!!! I have been trying out Abletons demo and the sampler and simpler are great. I can drop in a vocal chop and pitch it up and down while maintaining tempo using the complex pro/formant tool and without it sounding like a chipmunk or insanely low and slow. You know like Marshmello or Garrix etc. I use Logic Pro x tho, and the exs24 just sucks, there is no warp option or formant or anything. When you move the pitch up or down on piano roll like I said, chipmunk or super slow and slow. I always hear about flex time in logic but that seems to deal with only audio and then how would I map that onto a sampler instrument so I could play different notes while retaining quality/pitch. I tried using the vocal transformer and it works ok, but having to use a plug in on it is not practical because if I have to change a note the sample is still in the exs24 which fucks up the speed and quality of sample when pitching drastically. What should I do? Should I say screw it to logic and move to Ableton (really used to logic by now but if I have to I will.) its a very important function for me since I produce trap/edm type stuff. Any help or input would be greatly appreciated. Side note, I'm testing melodyne as well but same thing, it all comes down to the damn sampler in the first place which messes up the sound. Ahhh hard to explain but hope someone knows what to do"

0,"Awesome tips, I am looking forward to trying this!","I am going to tell you exactly how I brew using a chemex. There are many ways, mine is just one, you will find yours, but here is a place to start. Get a burr grinder, digital scale, chemex white filters, chemex, gooseneck kettle, a pot to heat water, wood or plastic spoon, and some good, freshly roasted coffee at least 3 or 4 days off roast date. My sequence for two cups of coffee. Set Baratza Virtuosa at 26, put water on stove, fold paper and insert into chemex, pour about 1/4 cup tap water into chemex to wet filter, weigh out 37g of coffee and grind it, lift filter out of chemex and pour out any water, set filter back in with triple folds against the spout, dump coffee into chemex, set chemex on scale, zero out the scale, pour boiling water into gooseneck pot, pour about 1/2 cup water onto grounds in a circular motion wetting all the grounds, wait about 30 seconds and start circular pouring, using about 3/4 of the water, put down kettle and stir grounds, finish pouring until scale reads 650g. Wait a bit until water goes down some then scrape off coffee grounds from sides of filter and stir again. Wait until the water starts to come out in single drips, that is it. One tip I picked up is during brewing, pick up the filter slightly and rotate it about half an inch to make sure the groove in the front is an open airway, this prevents a seal from forming that can impede water moving through the coffee."

It was a bunch of old games minus everything that we liked about them and that's it. This is a brand new game, and a full remaster of another game that was widely regarded as the best in the series. With so much backlash against a game that turned out to be pretty damn good, I don't blame them at all for making people give it a chance. The only reason anyone has complained is because they don't like the movement. It is just pure opinion. I love the new cod games and they are all very well made."

But they can't be a top tier player in general, just like you wouldn't necessarily call a PC player, a top tier player on console. They are so different, they have to be classed differently in my mind. The fact of the matter is, if you stuck one against the other, with ones preferred input, the person using their preferred input would probably win on their platform, just because it's what they've put hundreds, if not thousands of hours into. That being said, if you gave a top tier console player time to get used to a new input method, I'm sure the transition from ""competitive"" (""pro?"") console, to PC wouldn't be insurmountable, it would just take time to get used to the new input method, a lot of the general skills, and idea's carry over"

0,Why don't they do something along the lines of Madden where you can download the latest roster and ratings.,"No matter what the cut-off date is, it will always be too early. It's not like sports, where there's an off-season, and an expectation of where the company will be when the game is released. You know certain players are going to certain teams in sports. You can program definate ""last season"" stats in, because there's an end date that they won't/can t push past. Baseball players have no December stats. Wrestling just keeps moving forward, keeps changing, and won't stop just to stay the same for the sake of a video game that 20% of their audience will buy. For this reason, I always have said that WWE games shouldn't follow the yearly release schedual. They should come out with a main game engine once every 3-4 years. They should then just release roster updates for that game every 6 months. Even if it's just DLC. Maybe a guy changes his gimmick totally. Imagine playing in 1998 with mankind, but he has his 1997/1996 look and gimmick. Wrestling changes fast. Too fast for software programers to keep pace. Just release a $60 game, and a $20 year pass. Then just release content every few weeks. Stat updates, costume updates. Storyline additions. Season mode additions. Whatever. Just make that $20 your pass for the the year, and every year you can either have an outdated game, buy individual DLC for $2 and $5, or, pay $20 and always be up to date. I haven't bought a WWE game since 2014. I may have bought some DLC had it come out recently. So WWE has made $0 on me from video games since roughly April of 2015. I think thats when I bought the ultimate warrior DLC. Point is, thats over a year of not spending ANY money on your video game properties, when you may have made $20-$40 on me. I hate the fact that my game is so outdated. The game may have came out in November of 2014, but the cutoff was probably around March of 2014. So the sheild are still a thing, half the roster is only there as DLC. I think the server might be gone. And yet, I won't buy a new WWE game until they make two things. 1) Create a championship 2) Defend created championships online against friends. Lets make that a thing in WWE games."

Instead of following streamer guides or whatever they think is easiest, they pick something slightly out of or off FotM meta to make their build critical items cheaper or for specific purposes. I doubt most first characters on EHC are meant to handle top-tier content. Many of them are likely made for farming either dried lake or T8-11s/uber lab for profit. Some of the people I know who play HC also have played for years, and aren't really in it for the FotM meta. They want to try builds they haven't tried, or perfect builds they've been theorycrafting for a while. On the other hand, I imagine ESC has a lot more fresh faces. New players are encouraged to use FotM builds because this game is damn complicated! Theorycrafting from scratch would require huge amounts of research into items, flasks, charges, damage calculations, ascendencies, and a massive and important passive web. I think it makes sense to see build diversity in HC."

The writers probably pitched this idea and thought it might be funny, which it could be in theory. The fact that this was not included, among probably hundreds of other scenes that didnt fit with the office vibe, is a testament to the Creators and producers who pick and choose not what would be the goofiest character arc but what would be best for the story line.

0,"Genuinely curious, how would the Rockettes here differ from the pastry chefs/bakers refusing to make cakes for gay weddings?","Nope, but it doesn't apply to Kim Davis. When you choose to be a civil servant, you don't represent yourself. You represent the people. It's their will, and their law, that you are enforcing. You do not elect yourself to special ""morality dispenser"" when you put yourself in her role. By NOT doing her job, she is actively harming the constituents that pay her salary. She is refusing to work, still getting paid, and enforcing her own morality on people who don't care what she thinks. Now let's jump over to our dancing friends. They don't want to perform, which harms no one. They would not be paid for the event, and they aren't enforcing their own will on anyone else. To the contrary, they simply do not want to be forced to show support of an individual that represents the opposites of their values. See how your comparison pretty much falls apart there, or are you still clinging to the idea that Kim Davis refusing to certify legal marriages is the same as these ladies refusing to dance? On a last note, I will say that the problem with the Kim Davis situation is that she was the only one who could legally certify the marriage licenses. No one in the office could do it and have it be legally binding. If there was an alternative to her signing them, then yes, I would say she would have been fully in the right to refuse the certification. But she can't use her political beliefs to fully block the marriages of legal couples that she doesn't agree with. Imagine if the Rockettes, for example, didn't just refuse to perform, but made it so NOT ONE ELSE could perform either. They said that because THEY didn't want to do it, no one else could either. Oh, and they got paid. That would be a better comparison."

Yeah, he was talking about Hillary Clinton, but if you watch the actual video, his hat stands out to me. He's a guy from Flint, MI, talking to a crowd in Ohio. He's wearing a SF 49ers hat. A red hat. A hat that if you saw at a rally from the back, you'd assume was a MAGA hat. There is 0% chance he didn't realize what wearing a red hat would imply. The fact that it had nothing to do with Ohio or Michigan cements to me that he actually likes Trump, but he wanted to keep that Liberal gravy train a-flowin."

I've heard her say multiple expletives over the speaker and very rudely tell people that she can't understand their accents (she literally said this to someone with a Boston accent, we're not from the East coast, but seriously?). Of course, no matter the accent, she sends them to me at the first window and tells me to speak to them in 'their language.' I made the mistake of telling her I speak Spanish and a very small amount of Norwegian and Italian, which I guess to her means I speak every language. Unless they speak Spanish, I of course speak with them in English and get everything sorted out, all the while apologizing profusely on behalf of her. This has happened many times and after nearly every single one she says the exact same thing - she's amazed I can even understand them and that 'they should really learn better English.' Earlier this week she even told me, ""Your English is amazing for a 'spic."" I am half Spanish and half Russian, it didn't really bother me, but god she really has no common sense, she doesn't know how to think before she speaks. If she had said that to another one of the Latina ladies she would have been fucked. Not only is she racist, she shows up ten minutes late every god damned day, then complains about her ankle hurting or feeling like she's going to puke, and of course 'forgets' to clock out when the managers get fed up of her complaining and send her home. I've also watched as she threw hamburger buns at a maintenance man because 'he was in her way.' She's being fired this weekend though!! She got into a fight with some other white trash girl outside the restaurant, cops were called and I personally enjoyed watching their little scuffle. The store manager told her they're having a 'talk' with her tomorrow when she comes in. Hallelujah!"

See, I get why Kanan is worried about Ezra going to the dark side. But, I can't really understand why is it so important to choose sides now that the Jedi Order is done. Like chancellor palpatine said when the clone army was created, ""Different times require different strategies"". Is it really possible for Ezra and Kanan to defeat the dark side exclusively with the light side, following the jedi principles? I don't think the Jedi Order was very well suited for war; it's principles are often in the way of taking more rough actions, that although may not be popular or ""good"", are necessary for ending the war. Besides, as Ahsoka said before, the Jedi Order itself was clearly broken, to begin with. The development and the conflict created with the Clone Wars was enough to prove that it's radicalism wasn't being enough to take the necessary steps, while at the same time, blinding the most powerful jedi. So why is it important for the rebels, who clearly need all the help they can, to rely on old principles that failed them in the past? Why can't every lasting jedi be like Ahsoka and rely on the Force to do good things, instead of relying in and old ""fable"" of the Jedi Order like Kanan does? I personally thing that, as long as Ezra would be able to control his power to the dark side, it's not only acceptable but pretty great that he AND Kanan stay on a more grey area of the force; Neither the Jedi Order or the Sith Order. Whatever, just use the force as much as you can to get the empire off their backs, lol. After all, it's the rebellion. What do you guys think about it? Kinda wanted to have this discussion for a while :P"

0,"Just keep in mind that maybe the kid learned his attitude from the mum, and she may think his behaviour is ok.","Stepson's friend continuously says racist remarks at my house. Should I keep my mouth shut? My husband (white) and I (black) share custody of his two teenage kids with his ex-wife (white). My husband and I only live a five minute bike ride away from his ex and the kids split time between each house. My husband and I also have a toddler son together. My stepson, who I will refer to as Nick, has a couple of friends that he often brings over after school. Nick is 14 and is a pretty good kid, but he is a little social awkward, as are his friends. We don't allow the kids to have televisions in their bedrooms, so the boys will normally hang out in the living room to play video games. I recently overheard one of Nick's friends (Jake) say that they need to ""find all the (n-words) and kill them."" I was shocked, but didn't say anything at first. It got worse and I told Jake that we don't use that language in our house. He apologized and didn't use it again. Jake came over yesterday and used the n-word again. I explained that we don't use that word and he told me that his mom said he could. I told him that I can't control what words he uses outside of my house, but we don't allow that kind of language in our house. He threw a little fit and said that he won't use it anymore and I left them alone. Nick later told me that Jake continued to use the word and that it made him uncomfortable. I'm just not sure what to do. My husband and his ex say to let it go. I am considering calling his mom, but that seems weird to do at this age. It's just not a word I want to be used in my home, especially with a toddler in the house, and I feel like that should be respected. Am I wrong here?"

1,I love how the borgies have it all figured out!,"It's cute how idealistic you are, you have a lot to learn about the world. Fact is, there is no perfect system. A few things though... 1- What does person A's dad having cancer have to do with anything? Person B's dad is just as likely to have cancer too. 2- Garbage collectors are actually paid a decent wage. 3- Garbage collectors aren't garbage collectors because of some sort of altruistic desire, they just aren't qualified enough for something else. 4- Being wealthy and getting an education isn't a bad thing, nor is running a business and making money. 5- There is nothing wrong with buying stocks and selling them to someone who is willing to pay more for it later. 6- People don't buy houses and leave them empty until they appreciate so they can make money off it when they sell it, if anything they buy a house and rent it out to people who cannot afford to purchase it themselves. 7- People aren't homeless because rich people buy multiple houses. 8- No businessman is going to ensure people can afford less stuff, they would want to have people afford more stuff because they would be buying more of the stuff he sells, thus making more money. 9- People affording less stuff isn't a bad thing, that would be the opposite of consumerism, which is actually a root cause of capitalism. Create/build something that people want and then sell it to them. 10- The free market for products spurs competition, innovation and actually can regulates prices. A true free market can't really exist though because people are greedy, so we have a regulated free market to prevent collusion and monopolizing of limited or essential resources. 11- I fail to see any connection that makes a free market and protecting workers any kind of opposites. Some things you missed... What about person C? The person who grew up poor, got scholarships to go to college and because a successful business owner? What about person D who was rich, handed everything in life, went to college but learned nothing, was given a company and had no idea what to do and ended up broke and living on the streets when his family ran out of money? Why do you think there are only 2 types of people possible? What is really needed is a blend of every possible system, taking some pieces of each and fitting them together to make a world that works as well as possible. There will always be a disparity between the rich and the poor, and both of those will always exist relative to one another. If we truly had a world where everyone is equal and everyone received an equal share regardless of what they contribute, what motivation would anyone have to put in any kind of extra effort? Why would anyone want to collect trash? Why would anyone want to clean septic tanks or shovel manure? Why would anyone invent something new if there was nothing to gain from it? Who would do all the shitty, dangerous, gross jobs if there was no need to do them because they would still get an equal share even by doing nothing? We don't live in a pure capitalistic society, we live in a world that is capitalistic, but there's quite a bit of socialism thrown in everywhere. Also, your very post is ignoring one thing that is most important, and makes a massive assumption that actually favors capitalism over anything else. You assume that the poor person is unhappy because they are poor, and you assume the wealthy person is happy. You are equating wealth with happiness, thus endorsing a society where someone needs to earn money to become rich somehow to be happy. That's just false, not all rich people are happy and not all poor people are unhappy."
