0,Fair enough on the criticism and I agree with your sentiment towards body autonomy but the government already does limit autonomy.,"No, of course not. I have seen a fair share of crazy liberal feminists who believe that women are entitled to everything because they are women, but I have also met plenty more women who work their ass off and achieve everything quite fairly. Now, the minority of women who support the *my choice* abortion are those who are, quite frankly, crazy. Again, those are the 'fringe' parts of liberalism. Classical liberalism is nothing like that. They believe in both rights *and* responsibilities. I am not even a liberal, I am a conservative and so I feel that all men and women should be free to do as they please with their body. The concept of body autonomy is essential to the functioning of human rights. If we do not have body autonomy then everything else falls apart and we certainly should not have the expectation that everyone will defend their freedom with the barrel of a gun because that's not how one should defend their freedom, unless absolutely necessary. Anyway, I think I am digressing a little. Don't use an internet forum as a barometer for what women think, especially two chromosomes. That place is an effective safe space, much like coontown or fatpeoplehate used to be. Plus, a lot of women think that 'being a man' is about acting like a dick and, so, a lot of young feministas basically act like that to try look 'hard and cool', like teenage boys. Irony is, most of them are 18-23 year olds..."

0,"A difficulty based on distance, the ring-biome mod and void decay would be amazing together as a modpack.","What are your thoughts on a Distance Based Difficulty Mod? One of the classic tropes of fantasy worlds is that the farther you go out into the wilds the more dangerous it becomes. Cities are safe, and the creatures you find near them are weak, but things get harder farther out. Bosses are always in ""the deepest part of the forest"" and such. It's hard to recreate this feeling in Minecraft because the only only factors affecting mob spawning are light level and the occasional spawner block. **There's little incentive to travel farther from your base than you must to find a dark area.** If you want to fight a lot of mobs, the best way is usually to build a spawn room rather than to explore the wilderness. And if you do decide to find mobs through exploring at night, they're basically the same difficulty anywhere you go. So, **what mods can you think of that could fix this?** I don't know of any, but I've thought of some ideas that could go into one: * The most basic mod for this would be to make beds prevent mob spawning within a radius of a chunk or two. * A more advanced one would have mob spawn rates slowly scale up with increasing distance from a chunk with a bed that's in a villager house or from the world spawn until they've scaled up or above the vanilla spawn rate. This would allow you to build relatively safe cities anywhere by placing a bed, but have wild lands in-between * Spawn rate could also be tied to y-level with the spawn rate increasing back towards or above normal as you dig down even if there's a bed/city above to simulate the classic dungeon-under-the-city trope in caves. (dungeons would also be a cool thing to spawn under villages in general but that's another mod in itself...) I'm not a great java coder, so there isn't a large chance I'll be able to make this myself. Any devs who find it interesting feel free to steal anything here. **What are your thoughts?** are there mods that already cover most of this? What other mods can you think of that would force the player to travel thousands of blocks from their base to explore or setup additional bases far away from their home?"

Rural states get more voting power than states with large urban populations.

After it's been narrowed down from there, then an actual person has to look at the fingerprints. You need like 100 points of comparison for it to be a ""match"".

My understanding is that you don't want to put green branches into an aquarium. I've got a couple small tanks (5.5g, 2.5g) that I'd like to put these in, but only if I don't have to leave them outside for year(s) first. The branches are small, the biggest one has a maximum diameter of 0.75 inches, but they're mostly closer to 0.25-0.5 inches. The outer black bark is gone, but the inner red bark is still on them. Here's my questions: 1) Is there any way I can quickly dry them out in an oven or something? Would they be safe to boil and use at that point? 2) Usually the things I've read say that the bark needs to be removed or it'll slowly peel off. As long as it were to not peel off in tiny pieces, and as long as it were safe, I wouldn't mind that. I don't have a sandblaster to remove bark with either.

1,Blizzard should also add a trading system so we can trade skins and things like that.,"OverWatch ""LoadOuts"": Is overwatch combat diverse enough? I've had this thought in my mind for a long time now, about how overwatches combat design is very simple. We get to choose a hero, the hero has a kit and you go kill some dudes. It's a good formula, and it works. My idea takes the original idea and builds upon it, Keep in mind these ideas I am presenting don't necessarily have to or will ever have an impact on the current state of the game. That being said I want overwatch to introduce ""Loadouts"". Loadouts would work similar to how the league of legends rune system would work where people could choose how to improve their gameplay through through additional increases in stats or even passive abilities, this would introduce strategic diversity among the champion pools. This would give players more to think of when playing this competitive mode. Example: a loadout could include an increase to the shield power of winston's shield (E) along with more damage with a trade off for less HP and mobility. Perhaps. This is just a basic/rough concept of how it would work, please tell me how it would be broken or otherwise. My other idea was something that came to me when they announced sym getting two different ultimate abilities. My idea takes that further and allows each hero to have two different kits. This gives players more options for their play styles and changes the dynamic of the game. This idea would most likely take up a lot of resources and less likely to happen. And lastly these changes would happen on a different game mode, so as to not effect the original style."

0,Thank you for your service.,"People regularly ask why it takes so many cops to arrest a person. Thing is, to restrain somebody safely, to minimise the risk of them twisting and breaking something, it takes a few people. It takes numbers to prevent idiots trying to get in on the incident despite having no involvement. Professional agitators, nosy people, ""pranksters"" trying to get involved on film for youtube hits and those that just hate the police, looking to take advantage of a situation whether that be to give a few kicks or put the windows through of the police vehicle. source: cop."

The entire first gen really needs to be retouched and refactored badly which should include some reimaging from the concept artists. Beyond that we have all of the ships that have been sold that haven't been made yet. There were a few bursts of ship releases early in the year but that has slowed down tremendously with the patch rate in the last half of the year. Honestly if they want to crank ships sales out like this they need to separate ship drops from major patches. It's been nearly 3.5 months since 2.5 dropped and we got the Reliant and the Argo. In the first half of the year we got 6 new flyable ships. Which makes this last six months a slower rate of ships coming down the pipeline.

I've always personally been a fan of armor acting as a damage subtraction modifier instead (essentially making high armor targets impervious to high rate of fire low damage weapons), since it at least is different, whereas the current system could be entirely eliminated in favor of just more base health. Then you can have armor *penetration*, which reduces how effective armor is at subtracting your damage, and a flat health type modifier which multiplies your damage according to its type. If you want a more involved system, just make armor its own health bar like shields, and make certain damage types reduce it over time. Damage type modifiers would affect armor health and enemy health separately, so you don't deal +1000% damage because the enemy has 1 armor point left."

First, it never looks real, makes absolutely no sense and takes a stupid amount of preparation to even make the move while the opponent stands there waiting for him to do it. By far the worst move in his arsenal.

Not the most lengthy trip, but the elevation changes at Mt Rainier can kick your butt (especially if you're a flatlander like me). Ipsut Creek is a great place to camp, because although its technically a back country camp, it used to be a car camp.

I really would like to appreciate all my peeps who make devoted as dank as it is. No other way to put it, really. I love how its a fairly relaxing civilization server instead of CivCraft. Less grind = more fun for everyone. Without factories on Civ - you couldn't do much at all. Here, you can thrive with or without them. No, I don't hate Civcraft because I do play fairly often and I've made quite the bunch of friends there. I've seen development yet it was very slow. But this ain't no complainin post about Civ. This is my post about appreciating devoted for what it is. So even though I just started devoted and I knew right from the start when 3.0 of devoted launched that the experience would be amazing and I wasn't dissapointed. This server is great. To the staff: keep up the hard work! If you agree with me, leave an upvote or reply with your thoughts on Devoted! Thanks for your time. Stay dank. -tnug out."

Adding an actual semicompetitive q would split the player base tho, but honestly they could drop a few game modes that they don't update, balance for, or put at the bottom of the list where no one can even fucking see it to q Just a thought from a player that doesn't want the commitment or stress of ranked, but does want the competitiveness/giving a shitness of ranked"

0,Currently in stat and holy shit this just helped enormously in getting the concept of P tests down,"This isn't that hard. I'm not going to go all hypothesis testy for this, but we can certainly calculate a confidence interval on his measurement. If we believe that p = 1/3 and we have enough data points (which at nearly 300,000 we do), we can estimate a standard error for our measured p using sqrt{p(1-p)/n}. A 95% confidence interval would then be 1.96*se(p) = 0.00086. Given the actual data we can say with 95% confidence that misha's true summoning rate falls within the interval 33.38% +- 0.086% or [33.29%, 33.47%]. Increasing n an order of magnitude to just about 3 million games, would bring the lower limit of our confidence interval to 33.35%, which is above 1/3.

I was working in a sunglass and lifestyle store when I got bored and decided to cover myself from head to toe in snowboarding gear. All the way from pants and jacket to gloves, facemask, goggles and hat. Not a single piece of skin was showing. I goofed off in the store for a bit and then decided to go stand in the big glass front window. This is where the FU happens. I am standing in there as still as can be and getting a couple of weird looks but nothing too strange. For the most part people aren't noticing me. Then a little kid (maybe 12 years old) comes right up to the glass and stares at me, obviously noticing something isn't right. That's when the practical joker in me takes over and I throw my hands up and scare the crap out of the little bugger. He runs off half scared half laughing and I leave the window display and get back to actually working. A few minutes later an older fellow comes in and says he saw what I did and that it was incredibly racist...ohh, I didn't mention that the little kid was black, because to a normal person they wouldn't even think in those terms. The older fellow was black too. He goes on to tell me that he's a professor at one of the Ivy League colleges across town and that he studies this kind of stuff regularly and that what I did was incredibly racist. He lectured me a bit more, and I just stood there and listened since I was so caught off guard then he finished by saying that it was because of people like me doing that kind of stuff that black people were afraid of white people. TLDR: pretended to be a mannequin. Scared a little kid who happened to be black. Got called a racist."

Take Ronin for example, the sword titan. Often, he states ""We are stronger together, pilot"" and it's true. With his processing speed, algorithms and logic combined with a humans intuition and risk/reward assessment (robots err on one side or the other, a human does not) they can make combined decisions leading to the best outcome. Also. A human can sacrifice themselves, a titan cannot sacrifice their pilot. Alone they are formidable, but together, they are only challenged by an equal."

Not everyone it seems had their Sears Citi converted to the TYP system (and if you don't have the Citi Preferred, Premier, or Prestige, they would be the non valuable, non transferable points).

Vocalizing your intentions or feelings or anything opens up alternate paths for redundancies and fuck-ups. I know my desired effect, I know how to achieve it, I know there must be sacrifice. There is nothing else. Speaking aloud simply opens too many doors. I want to be like lightning. Find the quickest, most powerful path to my desired intention. In this way mistakes usually turn out to be wonderful lessons as long as you remember there is ALWAYS sacrifice involved in all endeavors.

It actually sort of worked out well for me, because I needed a flight to San Francisco next weekend for a conference. The best part is that I get reimbursed, so can't go wrong, right? Well, I had to purchase my ticket on October 4th to confirm my attendance, but when I called the Concierge the next day to ask about retroactive credit (because the category doesn't start until today), they said that they could not extended. I even explained that I also have the PRG, and having heard about the announcement on Tuesday and thinking it couldn't have worked out any better, would otherwise have put it on my PRG. I ended up cancelling the ticket thanks to United's 24-hour cancellation policy, but the price has since jumped in the past 24 hours to about $200 more for the transcon. However, the other reason I was pushed to cancel was because some of the logistics around the conference seem a bit sketchy. * They were supposed to contact me 3 weeks out (about 2 weeks ago) confirming my attendance. They did it only two days ago. * They needed a confirmed ticket to SFO as a way to confirm attendance, which I sent them two days ago almost as soon as I received their email. * I haven't received any more email since then. My plan was to book a hotel for the weekend as soon as they got back to me, but since they haven't... Anyhow, I think it'll work out in the end. If I have to pay the higher price for a ticket, it just means more points to look forward to in the future."

It is kind of like cars. The earlier all mechanical chassis and engine made sense, and could be understood by anyone with a few hours and a basic tool set.

1,Don't worry they'll get people to repair people's because there's so going to be demand for 100000s of repair people in a given area !,"That's a false conclusion. Two examples that are more local are: the self checkout at many major department stores. One person watching over 6-12 self checkout lanes is not making 6-12 times what one register clerk makes. So even with the labor pricing staying the same there is still phasing out of employees. Another is Walmart laying off 91 people in their optical labs. White collar jobs that require at least some modicum of being above the lowest common denominator are still at risk. The final and less local example is Foxconn. You may remember this company for making the news due to work related stress induced suicide attempts. They just announced 60,000 layoffs. It's a Chinese company and organizations have been outsourcing to China for slave labor wages for decades. Line all of those up. You can't get paid the same always, or you face replacement. You can't be paid above the average because it is work related replacement due to automation. You can't even be slaved to mental collapse. If a job can somehow be replaced by automation, it will. Employee payment has literally nothing to do with it. Lights out factories exist. One or two rooms in a facility where humans regularly occupy the space, the rest of the rooms can be completely dark with no hiccups. Bill gates says society isn't ready for the amount of job loss automation will spur on. This finger pointing to people who deserve a fair and living wage is proof of it"

About 2 months later he had a candle burning in his room with the window open. The wind blew a sombrero off the wall and onto the candle. It caught some clothing and part of the bed and the room started to go. It triggered the smoke alarm and I was able to get to it with an extinguisher before the room was fully involved.

0,"I honestly wouldnt mind if DE decided to take a look at all weapons that were ""X weapon but worse in every way"" and give them some unique mechanic so that we dont just have like 20-30 useless weapons compared to the others.","Has DE Learned to Work Around Power Creep? Let me start by saying power creep will always be a thing in WF and I do not see that ever stopping. I do however believe that DE has taken some steps to slowing it. Passives are amazing! They change not only how you build weapons and what you decide to use but also how you play the game. A perfect example is the Telos Boltace which is quickly becoming a go to melee. Is it as powerful as the Galatine Prime? Debatable, but for killing a single tanky target no. But the way you play with the Telos Boltace changes everything. A somewhat good example of how weapon passives change the game is the Borderlands series. I would never want to see WF be as crazy as Borderlands, but some this are already starting to line up. For instance the Fomorian Accelerant mod for the Drakgoon adds a passive to make shots bounce off walls. This is similar to the Conferance Call shotgun in Borderlands 2. Furis's Winds of Purity mod turns it into a Moxie weapon. Why cant warframe have weapons that you can throw the clip out to explode doing damage equal to the bullets remaining? Or a sniper rifle the shoots a volley like Ivaras bow? Just add more cool passives and players will build around them."

For immigration, the individual is not in control. They are powerless over it except for the laws that we have put in place. We can't individually control it. There is no rehab to turn to for help.

1,You middlegroundists are what's wrong with this country!,"This goes both ways, I find. As frustrating as it is with conspiracy theorists (I mean I use that term even loosely because, as you mentioned, the extent of research these people do is a bunch of YouTube videos and Anonymous's Facebook feed nonsense) calling everyone who doesn't believe this trash ""sheeple"" and demanding that we ""wake up!"" and ""do research"" is equally as annoying as people who sit on the other side and attack them, saying that they're wearing ""tin foil hats"", that they are ""crazy"" and ""uninformed"". Honestly just let people form their own ideas even if they seem ridiculous. Their crazy ideas aren't hurting you. It seems that with social media everybody is quick to calling each other a *somethingist* and tell others how wrong they are. So what if they're wrong? and so what if someone doesn't believe what you do? It's exhausting, tiresome and pointless to try and convince a stranger on the internet to switch to your side, and it never happens. Basically I just hate both types of people with regards to this."

I'm not putting the blame on Singer or Apocalypse or anything really other than the entire franchise has kind of become tedious and the characters aren't exciting anymore. Deadpool and Quicksilver are the only two characters in the entire franchise that hold any interest for me personally, and they aren't enough to prop the whole thing up. Wolverine wasn't enough to prop the whole thing up from the beginning, but they got as much mileage out of him as possible and now it's time I believe for the whole thing to go into the vault for 5 years and then go full reboot with a whole new cast of actors playing the X-Men. As far as a new arc to reboot the franchise with? I'd be happy to see Broodfall on the big screen."

And it doesn't mean there are no talented women (really?); just that by-and-large women and men tend to have slightly different talents and inclinations. What we need is equality of opportunity, and a willingness not to stereotype on the basis of aggregate behaviours, rather than equality of outcome. By far my best ever boss was a woman: calm, collected, fair, highly-competent, and treated everyone with respect. There are lots of good, intelligent women out there doing good work.

When they persecute us, this means the Torah is getting fulilled and it also helps us to consolidate our tribe and not assimilate among them. Also, these idolatarian Christian Goys with reddish faces and hairs are the descendants of Edom(=red), and our Rabbi says that they're kind of like animals, barely human, and just like the wild animals don't like to have masters, these goys alike don't like to have masters! But as the Torah says, we will be masters and we will give a lot of loans to other nations, but we will take no loan. Also, the descendants o Jacob (=Jews) will destroy the descendants of Edom (=Christians) just like it's written in the Torah, and the Torah is what we repeat every day and on each prayer, so this belief is deeply embedded into our subconsciousness..."""

1,Spoken like a true Tumblrina,"Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to eat 800 big Macs, but take it from this old McDonald's rat, I've spent my entire adult life eating at McDonnald's, and a program like this one can do more harm than good. If you only eat big Macs one part of your body (and that's all a single burger type like Big Mac is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times. Big Macs basically only train the gut muscles and to some extent, the esophagus. What you really want to do is train your entire digestive system, all the major gut groups (esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, and kidneys) at the same time, over the course of a Big Mac meal. So, you will need to add large Big fries, and Large coke with it. Ask for the ""Go Big"" program. I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three big meals! Falling in love with eating big Macs, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make. But do it right, okay? My advice, find any McDonnald near you, with qualified burger flippers who will design your burger for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for physical fatness. Three to 5 burgers a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is). And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being out of shape the first time you walk into McDonnalds. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway. Now get out there and get fat! :-)"

In a game, people gave him shit and told him he wasn't doing well, even though he had gold damage and elims, which are the only ways for them to gauge his performance. Now, of course, Soldier might not work because of the enemy comp, and if they'd said that, fair, but they told him to switch so *someone else* could play Soldier and do it better. And the entire team jumped on that. Not because they needed another hero instead of Soldier, but because they had somehow gotten it into their heads that the only reason they were losing was because of the gold Soldier being bad at Soldier. And that was enough for them to bully and moan the entire match. It was one of the stupidest things I've ever witnessed."

We made more use of CB radio and dialup internet to communicate than our mobiles. I think I got my first phone with a digital camera in about 2005, and by that time we were adults living in different parts of the country and never saw each other.

The current design of the client would have to change pretty dramatically to make this change because there's nothing behind the friends list in the updated client. If you minimized it, we'd have to dynamically stretch everything to fill the space. Remember, we've redesigned just about every page in the updated client to work using the current layout. And it's designed to fit comfortably at the current aspect ratio with the friends list basically sitting to the side of it. To get super real with y'all, we've had a few people saying this whenever they get access to the alpha, but we think it's mostly just because it's a change from the legacy client, and we're expecting it to die down on its own. No one has really brought up an interesting reason for redesigning everything just so you could minimize it as before. It's only really been ""I could before.""

0,Agree with a lot of this but if you're replacing Curry with a star guard why not replace Draymond with a star big man,"I think you can both be right. It's Curry in the sense that it's his team. The system doesn't function if he's not there, and everything's been built to account for his overwhelming offensive presence. It's Draymond in the sense that he's the pillar of the system that makes everything flow and allows us to run so many good lineups on the floor. I think if you replace Curry with another star guard (anyone as good as Westbrook/Harden down to Walker or Thomas) we're still the best team in the league. If you replace Draymond with a standard PF we don't go 73-9 and we probably struggle in a Bo7 against Cleveland or the Clippers"

John McAfee, who created it and is brilliant, sold the company for millions, basically retired and ex-patriot-ed himself to do whatever he felt like at the moment (which apparently included lots of drugs and hookers). After he sold it, the company that bought it (forget who) turned the antivirus into a bloated piece of shit which under-performed, and wormed its way into your OS to a point where you basically couldn't get rid of it. This is McAfee's fuck-you to the company that took his product and made his name into a joke in the IT community. In other words, McAfee got based."

I'm still basking in the glory of it, actually. I decided to eat at this hot dog place near work for lunch, and when I approached the register I noticed two employees chatting at the end of the counter. They're both teenagers, one awkward dude and a pretty, attractive girl. I stand there waiting and the guy looks over, sees me, and then turns to continue talking to the girl. I am not really the kind of person to say ""excuse me!"" so I just stood there. I was waiting long enough to get my phone out and text my friend about the situation. So dude's really working it, trying to be funny. All the while she's occupying herself with some task and laughing politely. Dude is laughing hard at his own jokes and straight up ignoring me. Finally the girl sees me and nods in my direction, telling dude to go do his job. When he walks up, I am really pissed off. I'm not really in the business of confronting strangers, but this one bothered me more than usual. So I say loudly, ""hey, glad you could take a break from trying to bang your coworker to take my order."" At this, dude looks quickly to the girl and she visibly recoils and says, ""ugh, what?"" Dude tries to recover, saying he didn't notice me standing there, but the damage had been done. He looked defeated, girl looked extremely uncomfortable, and now I'm eating in the corner watching them actively ignore each other and pretend the other doesn't exist.

1,But separating and demonizing people different then you has had such positive benefits in the past.,"This summer I went to an Asian festival. There were people there from all different Asian cultures sharing food, info, etc. There was a tent set up with a table for each Asian culture to share history and info to visitors. I went to support a friend who was competing in the dragon boat race but enjoyed the food and stuff as well. I do hoop dance so I brought my hoop with me and a bunch of old Asian men and women commented that they lived my Totoro rights, and the guys running that culture/info tent made me dance and share my dancing with them. It was great fun and I can't wait to go again next year. I posted about it on fb to a hooping group and got shit on about how I dont belong there and I was appropriating their culture and that the festival was made for people of color, not whites. So it's okay for Spanish and black people to go to learn, but not whites. Fuck that girl. I had a custard bun and faced to kpop. When I mention that I was excited that I heard music being played from Korea that I knew and loved (I love kpop, fight me), the girl on fb lost her shit. People like that drive me crazy. White people get so upset while the people actually a part of these cultures want nothing more than to share with us. :'("

If they have no objections, then I will now appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court."" Garland goes and tries to hear court cases an act as a Supreme Court Justice from then on out. What would be the reaction? Immediately obvious would be *substantial* push back by Republicans in the Senate, and such a disagreement would likely lead to the nuclear option and an end to Democratic filibusters. But that might happen regardless of Obama's actions. Would the other Supreme Court justices accept Garland, or refuse him? What happens when Trump comes to power and tries to replace him? Do the other Supreme Court justices accept this, or try to limit this action? If he does succeed in replacing Garland, does this have any potential to have him try and remove other justices for disagreements with him and would those efforts work?"

Toppings consisted of any ingredients (usually going bad, or something that wouldn't last the night) that could weigh the dough down so it didn't bubble up too much in the oven, which would have rendered the cleaning process less effective. The result was given away to the poor or sold at a very low price. By their nature, pizza toppings can be anything that weighs down the pizza dough and is somewhat edible."

From what I understand, the quality of boot camp programs can vary a lot, even within the same organization. I'm super happy with mine. I think my campus has something like a ~90% placement rate for graduates, and it's in a growing tech area (Indianapolis). In researching their curriculum, I found some reviews that almost scared me off, but I went to a Meetup they hosted and a few other events, talked to alumni, saw how plugged in they are with the local tech community, and I was sold. I heard from multiple people that it's the best decision they've made for their careers. I'm not finished with the program, but so far, I'm inclined to agree. Do some local research if you're considering options. Don't trust Google'd reviews unless it's relevant to your local campus. Scope out the relationships and connections with area tech employers. Talk to alumni, especially; they'll know better than anyone if it's ""worth it"". tl;dr - Maybe."

Now I know people count elixir and I do that myself. But it's more a rough estimate count not exact, especially the later in a match you go. The feature needs to go.

1,Obviously you can't survive a scooping because the scooper hits you right in the nutsack at high speeds,"Why Does Everyone Keep Saying That a Person Can't Survive Scooping? Every time the topic of scooping, the identity of Eggs, or the ending to the game is brought up, people immediately start reciting, ""You can't survive scooping!"" But why does everyone assume so? In truth, we don't actually know what happens when a human gets scooped. Nowhere in the game is it clarified, so don't go trying to pass speculation as fact. In reality, the only piece of evidence we have is that Ennard tells the player that, ""You won't die."" (side note: the final cutscene monologue's meaning is still up for debate, so whether or not it turns out that Michael believes the scooping should have killed him is unknown) Whether or not Ennard is a trustworthy source is arguable, but the possibility that scooping a human really doesn't kill them can't just be outright dismissed. Indeed, the only human we're aware of to be scooped, Eggs, survives. There might be some piece of actual evidence I'm forgetting, but it seems right now that a few people started saying that no one can survive scooping in order to make the events of the game agree with their headcanons, and now that there's evidence to the contrary, there are still a ton of people who still treat this speculation (albeit, reasonable speculation) as fact."

1,Yeah and I'm sure the tens of thousands of innocent Japanese Christians had it coming too.,"The Real History is the Japanese didn't ""buy-in"" to voluntary extortion white religious imprisonment. Throwing out the white European 'christians' is what lead Japan to close its ports for over 200 years. The Japanese saw the Holy Roman Church was using Jesuits as their exploratory invasion force, with their ""We Come In Peace"" routine. In Nagasaki, there is the site where a barrel the size of a large swimming pool was filled with boiling oil and 38 priests were thrown into that. Scorsese actually gets a lot of reality mixed in with his movies. Several scenes are real scenes in real life, like the scene in Casino where Nicky and his brother dig their own graves in a Kansas corn field, stripped to their underwear and beaten with baseball bats until they were *almost* dead, then thrown into the grave and buried alive. There are news photos from the discovery of their bodies, and Scorcese had the scene laid out just like it happened. He is showing the extremely close relationship of the Mafia with the Pope in his Godfather movies. He seems to be sending the message about how evil the Holy Roman Church has been, so it will be interesting to see how he portrays this pivotal period."

0,Free weekend happened.,"What happened to the community? :'( Hey everyone! I just decided to start playing this game again after other things (life, other games) took over. I was really excited because I remembered the community around the launch of Early Access to be nice, communicative, and overall helpful. The game felt fun. I used to play a lot of MOBAs, and this was a breath of fresh air. In the four games today (Christmas, of all days) I've had three teammates tell me that I'm ""absolute shit"" and to go ""kill myself"". What happened to this community? It feels like a MOBA community (not quite as bad as LoL, but it's starting to have a familiar feel to me) more than it used to feel just like a bunch of people trying to compete yet still enjoying the competition, even if someone is having a bad game. It makes me hesitant to keep at it, and I was excited about getting back into it. :'("

1,"You said ""I'm know there's more"" maybe you should've drafted your post on paper and had a coworker proof read it .","I babysat Kevin at work One of my ex-colleagues is Kevin. At the time, I was around 25 and he was almost 30. It was his first 'real job' out of college. He apparently grew up in a very sheltered, religious household. His dad is apparently a very high-ranking official in the UN. And due to an unfortunate strings of circumstances, Kevin sat next to me: * Kevin had zero computer skills. As a new employee, the company will issue you the standard computer, 8GB flash drive, along with employee handbook, etc. etc. He refused the flash drive because the size was too small (physically) and he believed it won't have any storage capacity. * So he kept having to borrow my flash drive. He also didn't know how to plug it into his computer and kept complaining that the flash drive is ""broken"". * We're an international company with offices in many countries. So, it goes without saying that we all communicate through email. He drafts EVERY EMAIL (even simple replies) on PAPER and then asks me to proof read it before he sends it out. He works as a COPYWRITER. * He asked me if the ""SEND"" button in Outlook means that his email was sent out. * He has more than once got scammed by those Nigerian Prince emails. He sends them his password when they ask for it. * He likes to google my full name (it's not a common name at all. Only I have it.). He googles it often enough that it pops up every time he types in the first letter of my name on Google. One day, he got so excited and showed it to me because I was ""FAMOUS"" because Google knows my name. * Each month, the housekeeper would walk around and issue out tissue paper to put at our workstation. The first time, he asked me what it was. * He drives the cleaning ladies insane by going into the pantry, use plates and mugs and put them back in the cupboard without washing them. When confronted, his argument was that he'll use it again eventually. * He likes to listen in on conversations. More than once, he would ask me what people in five workstations away were talking about. * He stares at people. ALL. THE. TIME. And stare at your computer screen and comment on what you're working on. * He didn't know how to put staples in staplers. When I helped him with it, his reply: ""Thank you so much. I'm just not used to these new technologies."" * He constantly asks people how much their salary is. * His probation period was extended (understandably. he was still asking me to proofread his emails). When HR told him, he threw a tantrum claiming that they can't do that because he already told his mom that he passed the probation. * He often takes his copywriting work home for his mom to check. This is what I can think of from the top of my head. I'm know there's more as he drove me nuts to the point that I wanted to quit and the Head of HR had to console me. I was his designated babysitter for the duration of his time there. People still joke that one day he might come into the office and shoot everyone. I would be the first to go."

0,"I'd love to see another faction that uses power armor, but with a lot more variation","Fallout Faction Idea This is going to be kind of long so I will add a TL;DR at the end I'm not even sure if there's going to be a new Fallout game out soon but I recently watched the FudgeMuppet video about the ideal Fallout New Orleans and it really got me thinking. One of the things I loved most about Fallout New Vegas was Caesar's Legion, in my opinion they're one of the coolest factions in the Fallout world so naturally I started to think about what, if any, role they would play in a new Fallout game. I think we can all agree on that the Legion ending from NV most likely won't be the canon ending. In my opinion the Mr. House ending is going to be, which leaves the question: What will happen to the Legion? I think the Legion will collapse, whether Ceasar lives or not won't change that. Without Caesar's leadership smaller fights will erupt amongst their own ranks, most likely resulting in the Legion splitting up into smaller groups. Some maybe going back to the tribes they originally were. If Caesar lives, this may take a bit longer. More important though, there will be people loyal to the old values of Caesar and the Legion. These splinter groups will, in my opinion, most likely be pushed out of old Legion territory, i.e. Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico, and further east. Which brings us to the state of Louisiana, and New Orleans (yeah I know Texas lies between New Mexico and Louisiana but ignore that for now. And Caesar's Legion was supposed to be in Texas anyway so we can work something out) So, here's what I'm thinking: Imagine you're exploring the swamps outside of New Orleans when you come upon a town. The town itself is built upon a small lake and held up by stilts which protects it from higher water levels and floods. This town is basically the New Reno of the region. Filled with booze, drugs, stripclubs and prostitutes. You enter the town and eventually end up talking to the mayor, a bartender or whatever. The person will mention something about a raider gang living deep in the swamp outside of the town and you will get a miscellaneous quest to go check it out. When searching for the gang you will travel on a small path through the swamp, when you're getting close to the quest marker a man dressed in rags with a bomb collar around his neck approaches you. He tells you about his ""employers"" and how they have work for you. He assures that you will be greatly rewarded for your services. He then gives you a quest to go and destroy the booze stills, or something in that style, in the New Reno-ish town. After completing the quest you return to the man and he tells you to follow him. The two of you travel down the small path, and coming up at the end of the path is a camp. Outside the walls of the camp there are people crucified, giving you a hint of what's to come. You enter the camp and is greeted by a person wearing weathered legionary armor. He welcomes you to the camp of The Cohort (or The Zealot's, Zealot's of Caesar or something like that, going to be calling them The Cohort for now) and gives you the story of the Legion, and a recap of what has happened since the second battle of Hoover Dam. This person won't be the leader of the faction but merely one in their ranks. He then proceeds to offer you a place in the group, maybe sending you out on a new quest to prove your worth. You continue to work for The Cohort and learn more about them. I want this really powerfull and mysterious character to lead them, sort of a Lanius figure, brutal but more charismatic. He must have other interests besides destruction. As you progress through the questline you eventually get called up to a meeting with this leader. He praises you for the work you have done and tells you that The Cohort has great plans for the wastes of New Orleans. He tells you about the second coming of The Legion, how you and the rest of his men will unite the tribes and towns of the region and eventually march on New Orleans, claiming it for The Legion. The whole idea of The Cohort is to give the player the choice to revive the dying Legion and finally giving it the Rome it deserves. I want them to have very similar values to those of the Legion, such as prohibiting the use of alcohol and drugs, using slaves and having a totalitarian dictator as a leader. They will also use the same roman hierarchy. I have more ideas but I feel that this is enough for now. Let me know what you think and if you want more. Also feel free to comment if you have any ideas to improve on mine! TL;DR I have this idea of a faction that will originate from Caesar's Legion from Fallout New Vegas that I would love to appear in a new Fallout game. Essentially you would be able to give The Legion its rebirth and unite the wastes of New Oreleans/Louisiana, or wherever the game takes place, under its flag."

There are quite a few named weapon/gear out there so there is still a layer of RNG plus the usual stats roll RNG. I understand the point of making the item rare and the ""rewarding"" feeling a player gets when one drops, but the current system is just a painful grind. I know players who have ran lex over 300 times with no Barret Drop or a drop that is absolutely horrible. This scenario is also true for other players who are grinding the other missions for named items. yes i know you can be viable without Barrett.. i've been running reckless + skulls for a while now and I do very well in the DZ.

0,Keep the dog dump the dude is the only answer dog owners ever need.,"SNW and the engagement BIL Hey gang! I found time to write a bit so here it goes! Remember BIL is dating now SIL and he's now thinking of marrying her. We were sitting in the room at the il's house just us three. BIL is talking to DH about it. SIL has a dog that she's had for years. It was a gift to her by her father when he became very ill, near death. The reality hit him that life is short and he decided to start making good on some of his promises before he died. He always told SIL he would get her a dog, they were a military family, and he'd always say the next place we move I'll get it for you. So he got her this dog at that time and she loves her dog and he has sentimental value to her. Now, BIL has not yet met this dog because you know it's serious when you meet the dog. BIL sates to DH: Well the dog has to go. I have allergies and I can't be living with a dog. I know the dog has sentimental meaning for her because of her dad but my health is more important than a dog. She's waiting for me to meet the dog because she wants him to slowly warm up to me. This is stupid, it's just a dog... I don't see what the big deal is. I want to marry her but if we get married we'll already have to get an apartment and that costs money there (both of them at the time were living with their parents and would meet each other for dates and such). If we keep the dog then we have to pay extra money for pet rent and I'm not paying extra money for a dog!!! DH is just nodding his head and listening (he's pretty laid back and quiet always like this guess it's true opposites attract). I'm thinking how rude is this guy? He wants to marry her and is supposed to love her but can't have compassion for what she loves??? I know he's SNOT JR. For sure. Anyway he meets the dog and they get engaged. They have all these big events that I find my way out of because I can't stand being around them. They had a family celebration right after he proposed and a joint couple shower. SNW knows how creative and crafty I am, especially after my wonderful diy wedding decor, so she asks me to help her decorate for the rehearsal dinner. I reluctantly agree to help her. DH and I have been married over 3 years at this point. SNW has never made any efforts to call, text, smoke signal, or communicate with me in any way or form any relationship with me. Can't remember if I posted about this before but I did invite her to an event to be the bigger person, but she basically fought me even giving it to her. The event was based on a book and I wanted to buy her the book and put the tickets inside as a Christmas gift. She was like oh I don't want a book. And then proceeded to text DH about how she doesn't want whatever I'm trying to get her, that he knows the type of gifts she likes and to stick to that. I was so angry... I was raised knowing when people get you a gift you accept because the person thought about you and took their time to get it for you so be grateful! Guess not everyone learned that. I still invite her after my moms advise but said well I was trying to do this for you but since you didn't want it I'm asking you now would you like to go with me. Then she's like oh I would love to go I had no idea thats what it was, super nice in front of everyone. We went to the event and she straight up did not talk to me the whole time and went off in her own during the intermissions. Sorry for going off topic but you get the point. Now all of a sudden she's blowing me up about this wedding rehearsal. She texts several times a day and calls about her ideas and sends me pics. She's always like Hi how are you then goes for what she wants... I'm not fooled at all, she never cared how I was doing for over three years. She says Oh well SIL and I have been talking about the plans and blah blah blah. Basically trying to run in my face that she talks to SIL all the time and she's being involved in the planning. unlike with my wedding, but that's because she got mad at me for not doing what she wanted and did CBF the rest of the time I was planning. I tell DH about this sudden change of behavior and how much involved SNW is in this wedding as compared to ours. He suggests well maybe because she has a good relationship with SIL she realizes she needs to do better with you and this is her way of reaching out to you... I say maybe but I know its all fake..."

They even accept that I am an atheist without shunning me from volunteering or participating, reminds me a lot of this place actually. I don't want to push my kids away from faith if I can avoid it, but my son is very shrewd and skeptical by nature. He figured out leprechauns are not real a few months back and the dominoes have just kept falling. He finally came right out and said to me on Tuesday that he doesn't think Jesus and God are real either, because their stories are very magical too, like the others. I did my best to respond to him as charitably as I could on the side of believers, but I just don't know how to address the issue to a (very intelligent) 5 year old. What would you say?"

Have you guys ever felt like the characters and the world of Paladins has too much of their own personalities and, most of the time, they don't seem to mix well togheter? When I first heard the name ""Paladins"", what I had in my was this medieval world where people battle using knights, magic and whatnot, but the game is set on a totally different reality. You have people using high technology powered by magical crystals, then you have people that haven't decided what they want to be... Have you guys taken a look at Skye? Like... she's an ELF, that uses technology to be hidden and pretend to be a JAPANESE NINJA? What about Grohk? He's an OGRE but, at the same time, a NATIVE AMERICAN? It feels like Grohk heard about World of Warcraft and went too literal on the Shaman look. He's blue, he's a native american and he uses a staff powered by crystals. Fernando, Bomb King, Cassie, Barik and Drogoz seem to be from the same ""Medieval Characters with magical hi-tech weapons"" pack, but at some point in development, they forgot about it and said ""Fuck it, we will have japanese elves, russian soldiers and that tree from the other game. - Oh shit, he doesn't have a weapon? Er... give him... an axe? You throw them, but he gets another one out of somewhere. Not to mention the characters are homeless. Why are the some many inca temples in the game? Why does Androxus is trying to destroy Buzz Lighthyear? Why does Sha Lin's bow deal more damage than Kinessa's fucking sniper rifle? Is it because he's asian? I think characters and the world itself has too much of their own and they hardly share characteristic with each other. If you look at TF2, they are all soldiers, fighting. On Street Fighters, they are all martial artists, humanoids and differentiate themselves by their nationality and culture. Paladins is a fat kid with a Naruto bandana on it's head and earphones pumping country songs."

1,The whole movie is unrealistic to an insane degree...I don't know a Caveman being thawed out and awaken seems plausible.,"Encino Man- Robyn would have never gotten with Dave, it was a classic hollywood happy ending. I just watched Encino Man (on Netflix) Staring Brendan Frasier, Sean Astin and Pauly shore and have a real problem with the ending. Dave is obsessed over Robyn, the ""girl next door"", he constantly hits on her even though she has a BF, keeps old photos of when they were kids, and finds any excuse to be around her. Throughout the whole movie Robyn never gives any inclination that she sees Dave as more than just a friend even turning down his ""one phone call"" from jail prom proposal. She is nice to him throughout the whole movie, but it is obvious she is not romantically interested in him. However at the end of the movie when Dave sticks up for Link and defends him being a cave man something is supposed to magically change in Robyn where she loses interest in the free spirit Link, and becomes interested in Dave. Even allowing Dave to kiss her at his pool party. The whole movie is unrealistic to an insane degree, but its a fun little adventure. And for some reason Robyn's change of heart is more unbelievable than find a caveman and his counterpart stuck in ice and thawing them out. It's the classic Happy Hollywood Ending. Robyn should have stayed as a friend to Dave, and the ending could have been his self realization that what other think about him, is far less important on how he perceives himself."

Think of the MONEY, Hi Rez! All that sweet, untapped and quite sweaty money the furries would give you! Also, adding another generic badass normal character kind of takes away Victor Awesomes of being able to go toe to toe with Witches, Dragons and God Slayers with just an assault riffle and some grenades.

I've often created fun and interesting decks for non-competitive play. I like to try strange decks just to see if I can get them to work.

A problem, though, is that I'll make a funky pirate shaman deck or a rogue deck with only two minions, etc. and want to just dick around and have fun with it. I'll go into casual and lose to aggro shaman or control Mage enough times that I feel like I should be playing a ranked deck to have a little more fun, and I'm back to grinding ladder. This brings me to my point. You can choose the class you play against in practice mode, letting you see how your deck fares in certain match ups. I think it would be fun and innovating to be able to choose a deck for the innkeeper to play against you. This could have practical benefits (like a mirror match to test out changes in a ranked deck) or it could be really fun (giving the innkeeper a golden Milhouse Manastorm).

0,Swerved.,"He's doing way better than Cena was. WWE used to mute Cena's reactions, pipe in chants, and run an edited version for the West coast feed (which aired on tape delay) for Cena. At the PPVs they could only mute it but it'd be obvious people were booing Cena, so many people that were on the West Coast would only hear the boos at PPVs and would be surprised. Maybe because of the proliferation of the internet they aren't trying to do that now. But Reigns actually does get cheers and the boos aren't even that bad. He gets booed on his entrance, but he's such a good wrestler that usually during and after his matches the crowd can't help but pop. Cena was a garbage wrestler so he'd just get booed throughout the matches. When Cena would fire up it'd be even worse. When Reigns fires up most people actually like to see the Superman punch and Spear. Cena of course lasted for a decade plus. I'm sure Reigns can do that too. I think Reigns outside of promo work is a way better wrestler than Cena already. He looks cooler, has cooler moves, sells a lot better and works better matches all around. Heck even his promos, I see more potential, because Cena would just make kiddy jokes mostly."
