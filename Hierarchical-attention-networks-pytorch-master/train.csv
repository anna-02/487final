A game like this however just degenerates into a game of exploiting the AI and pathing so you can slowly plink away at its health while it can't get close enough to one-shot melee you. It just feels monumentally stupid as a player. It's artificial challenge by stacking stats against you.

Rural states get more voting power than states with large urban populations.

From what I understand, the quality of boot camp programs can vary a lot, even within the same organization. I'm super happy with mine. I think my campus has something like a ~90% placement rate for graduates, and it's in a growing tech area (Indianapolis). In researching their curriculum, I found some reviews that almost scared me off, but I went to a Meetup they hosted and a few other events, talked to alumni, saw how plugged in they are with the local tech community, and I was sold. I heard from multiple people that it's the best decision they've made for their careers. I'm not finished with the program, but so far, I'm inclined to agree. Do some local research if you're considering options. Don't trust Google'd reviews unless it's relevant to your local campus. Scope out the relationships and connections with area tech employers. Talk to alumni, especially; they'll know better than anyone if it's ""worth it"". tl;dr - Maybe."

Again, this is all under the assumption that Christ is the word of God, which can absolutely be discussed but I don't want to end up typing out 30 pages. If God tells us that he loves us, we have no choice but to believe him. If he is telling the truth to us and he really does love us, then that is great. If he is lying to us and he does not love us, then our belief or disbelief is irrelevant, we are doomed anyways. Also, I don't take his actions to contradict the notion of love. Could you give me an example of such an action?"

1,But but but then sniper riffles would be actually good at something and no no no snipers are not allowed to be so.,"Armor really needs a complete rework (alongside many other things...) to be something more than just a multiplicative damage modifier. I've always personally been a fan of armor acting as a damage subtraction modifier instead (essentially making high armor targets impervious to high rate of fire low damage weapons), since it at least is different, whereas the current system could be entirely eliminated in favor of just more base health. Then you can have armor *penetration*, which reduces how effective armor is at subtracting your damage, and a flat health type modifier which multiplies your damage according to its type. If you want a more involved system, just make armor its own health bar like shields, and make certain damage types reduce it over time. Damage type modifiers would affect armor health and enemy health separately, so you don't deal +1000% damage because the enemy has 1 armor point left."

0,"Me at 20 years old reading this ""....boooooring...let's party"" Now at 37 ""great advice wish I took it!""","I'm a CTO in town. If you want to talk privately about it, PM me. The tech workers with the best outcomes follow a simple plan: rent cheap (e.g. studio in Rainier Valley) until you can buy cheap (e.g. 1 br condo). I didn't. I rented a cool 2 br apartment and then a nice 3 br house for my first 5 years in town. That made it exceedingly painful when I bought a home; I could have saved $30,000 after everything was said and done if I'd been smart like that. Living with the parents is a stellar way to shortcut the process even further. Don't try to get to your happy point today. You'll pay for it for 10-20 years if you do. Figure out your saving plan for $100,000 and make it as fast as you can. If you stay at home you should be able to sock away $25,000 a year pretty easily and be a home owner at 26. The other side of the equation is to look at your income. You need to see your career arc in terms of at least three totally distinct tracks. For instance if you're in IT today, plot out your next 4 promotions. Skip from job to job if you can, but only when the new offer has a better title than the one you have today. Don't fret about salary; that always lags title if you're aggressive about promotions. It will catch up in spades. Use the time during your current track to get ready to switch tracks when you get to a senior, director, principal, or architect title. I switched from development (tester, programmer, senior prog, senior developer, software architect, principal architect) to security (security analyst, senior security researcher, senior security developer, director of security engineering) to management (project manager, program manager, director of engineering, VP technology, CTO). CTO income is somewhat better than tester income. Ideally, you'll do all three things at once: save hard like a war is coming, be aggressive about seeking promotions through company switch, and get training for your eventual track switch. The day will come when you sit up in bed and realize that none of the worries you have today matter at all any more."

0,What is the significance of the widow lady?,"MGTOW fairy tale: the happy village a long time ago in a little village there was a farmer and a farmer's wife, a miller and a miller's wife, a baker and a baker's wife, a hunter and a hunter's wife, a tailor and a tailor's wife, a carpenter and a carpenter's wife, a smith and a smith's wife, a barber and a barber's wife, a shepherd and a shepherd's wife, a fisherman and a fisherman's wife, and also a seamstress whose husband had died in the war. the carpenter built houses for everyone and repaired everything that anyone needed repaired, and the tailor made enough clothes for everyone and the barber kept everyone groomed and pulled any sore teeth anyone had and the fisherman provided fish for everyone and so all the men made all the things that the village needed. the wives of the village spent their days keeping the homes clean and looking after all of the children and everyone was very happy except for the seamstress. she made the finest embroidery and worked with silks and made fine things for the wives, and in return the men provided her what she needed from their trades. but she was sad because the wives looked down on her and she missed her husband dearly. one day a stranger came to the village. she told all the villagers that she was a femalist (which is *not* a code word for an evil, blue-haired, Satan worshipping, bloodsucking cunt-witch) and she told the wives that they were unhappy. she told them that they were being held back from having their own trades because the men wanted to be powerful. and the wives heard this and became angry with their husbands. and the wives and the widow and the femalist wrote rules and brought the rules before a meeting of all the villagers and voted on them. the men, thinking that everything had always been fine without these rules voted no, but the wives and the widow outnumbered them, and all the rules passed. one rule stated that no crops would be planted until there had been an environmental impact survey. and so Mrs. Farmer became an environmental surveyor and Mr. Farmer could not sew his crops until she had done her work. another rule said that no structure should be built except according to a drawing from a certified architect. and so Mrs. Carpenter became an architect and her husband could not build until she had planned his work for him. still another rule forbid baking except in an approved food preparation facility. and so Mrs. Baker became a health inspector and the baker could not bake until his wife approved his kitchen. and so all of the wives had jobs that had to be done before the men could do their jobs. the carpenter did wonder how his wife, who knew nothing of the strength of materials or of the techniques of building would draw better houses than he did. and the barber wondered how his wife would know if he were doing a bad job and needed his license revoked. and likewise all of the men wondered how their own wife having a job telling him what to do would make his work any better. but they all agreed that it was good that the women be strong and independent and have their own jobs. and so the wives set to work. first Mrs. Carpenter drew an office building where they would all go to work, and since he had not permission to build anything else, the carpenter built the office. it took a long time and he had to work twice as hard and twice as long for a long time to catch up with everything else that fell to disrepair in that time, but he agreed that it was good that the women have an office to do their work. next Mrs. Baker arranged for her husband to bring the wives food in their offices every day. and so the baker had to stop baking each day to make the delivery and he had to work a little later each night and still could not finish as much food as he had prepared before, but he agreed that it was good for the wives to have bread and cakes at their office so that they could work and be strong and independent. and likewise all of the wives set as a condition of their approval for their husbands' professions that they provide whatever the wives needed in order to do their jobs. and all the men had to work a little harder, and have a little less to show for it, but all agreed that it was good. and when the wives got their paychecks they took all of their money to the seamstress and bought finery and extra things for themselves. and the seamstress made more money than she had ever had and she bought as much as she could use of all the products that all the men of the village made and she bought even more than she could use for she was a wise woman and liked to prepare in case she were ever unable to work. and the men took their goods home to their wives and there was not enough food for anyone and there was not enough clothes for anyone and there was not enough of anything that anyone needed. the men had not made as much of everything and the seamstress had purchased much of their produce and sold it on to other villages. and everyone was miserable but everyone agreed that it was good for the wives to be strong and independent. and then the femalist came back to the village and talked to all the wives at the office while their husbands were working. and they told her of their woes. and she told them that they were unhappy because the men were still holding them back. and she counted all of their paychecks and found that they would not be able to buy half of all of the goods that the village produced and that they were suffering under an oppressive ""wage gap"". and she told them that they needed new rules to give them equal pay to their husbands and that then they would be happy. and the women voted to raise their own pay to that of the men. and the widowed seamstress voted with them because she was a wise woman and knew that she could raise her prices if her customers had more money to spend. and things became even worse than before. the women still spent all their money on fine apparel for themselves and the village became even more starved for food and necessities. and the men all asked their wives to keep more of their money for family expenses, but the wives were cunning and had been warned by the femalist that this was ""financial abuse"". and things continued to get worse. and the femalist came again and listened to the women lamenting their fate. and the femalist told them that they were all being abused and raped by their husbands. and she told them to all get divorced and that they should have custody of the children because they made as much money as the men and could care for the children themselves. after all, they were strong and independent now. and the femalist told them that the men should pay half of the expenses of the children to the women out of their earnings. and so the women voted and expelled all the men from their homes. and the men built modest accommodations for themselves and conserved everything they could keep from their ex-wives. and they were not as happy as they were before, but they lived a decent existence. and the ex-wives were more miserable than ever. and the seamstress was covered in fine jewels and was waited upon by barbarian slaves she purchased from the nomadic tribe of chad. and the wives were jealous and hated her. and the femalist came again to the village and told all of the villagers that they needed for the women to ""lean in together"" and ""ban bossy"" so they could get ""more women in tech"" and elect the ""first woman president"" because ""yes means yes"" and ""end street harassment"". and finally the men of the village understood that they were hearing meaningless words. and that these were satanic incantations of a cunt-witch. and they tied the femalist to a stake and burned her to death. and they fucked whores from the chad tribe and told their ex-wives to go fuck themselves. and the men and the widow lived happily ever after."
1,Well magic online prize structure was too calculated before we gotta add some randomness too it,"This is the online equivalent of a store offering prize packs for fnm instead of store credit. It's a cash grab for the company that forces the player to keep investing more money because instead of getting packs that can be sold for tickets that can be used to buy singles or enter leagues instead a player has to hope he opens one of the few ""modern rare/mythics"" that are actually worth anything. Just another cost on top of an already expensive and poorly maintained digital product."

Instead, they only hire geologists who are taught and do research consistent with an earth that is 4.5 billion years old.

1,Your story makes me feel so safe.,"I'd like to share my hilarious/painful YYC airport security experience from today So today, my wife, 4 year old son and 7 month old daughter left for Winnipeg for Christmas (no, going to Winnipeg wasn't the painful part). Anyway, I decided to help out and got one of those accompanying passes to help my wife get to the gate with the kids. We get through the metal detectors, and first off, my wife and baby get randomly selected for swabbing. That was fine but they also wanted to do a thorough check of one of our bins with a carry-on case, my shoes, phone and wallet. Anyway, before they can do our bag, they were taking, I kid you not, twenty minutes to frisk every crevice of a lady in a wheelchair so while waiting I told my wife to just go ahead and take the kids to so she could feed the baby and get food for my son. Finally, they get to our bag, rifle through it and find my wife's breast pump. The security lady swabs it and puts the sample in the machine, and the alarm goes off. I'm told there is an ""inconclusive"" organic substance on my ""child monitor"". I clarify that it's a breast pump so it might be breast milk. Doesn't matter, they need to see my baby. Yep, that's right, they need my baby right away. So I ask for my shoes but the lady says I can't have them. Then they call over a security escort to escort me to find my ""high security risk"" baby and he sees in my socks and says ""you need your shoes on sir"". I reply that they won't give them to me at security. So they conduct a ""pat down"" of my shoes and give them to me. So we are looking for my family and the escort is all impatient and asks ""Can't you just contact them somehow?"" to which I ask ""With what? My phone you won't let me have?"" and he shuts up. We find my family, bring them back and we are explained that because of the inconclusive swab, they have to pat down and swab THE BABY and ONE parent of our choice. Uuuuuh, what? Now remember, they already swabbed the baby and my wife once. I mean it's great that only two of us need to be pat down, but how does that make any sense whatsoever?! So ya, half our family had to be pat down, but one had to be the 7 month old baby. I mean, as much as it would have been annoying, would it not make sense that our whole family had to be pat down? Were they worried our baby was a drug mule or something? And if they were worried, why was patting me down, when I'm not even going on the flight, a viable option? And my son, with his beady little eyes, how come he didn't raise any suspicion at all?! And if none of this makes any sense, why is this even a procedure at all?! Anyway, lesson learned. Never EVER bring a breast pump on carry-on. We only had it in there because our check in case was a tad over the weight limit."

I really believe that Valve have something amazing in store for us, but we need to stop all the hate and give them time to work on it. I think we are being too hard on Valve and need to give them a chance to show they know what they are doing and are willing to do what it takes to give this game a bright future."

0,Swerved.,"He's doing way better than Cena was. WWE used to mute Cena's reactions, pipe in chants, and run an edited version for the West coast feed (which aired on tape delay) for Cena. At the PPVs they could only mute it but it'd be obvious people were booing Cena, so many people that were on the West Coast would only hear the boos at PPVs and would be surprised. Maybe because of the proliferation of the internet they aren't trying to do that now. But Reigns actually does get cheers and the boos aren't even that bad. He gets booed on his entrance, but he's such a good wrestler that usually during and after his matches the crowd can't help but pop. Cena was a garbage wrestler so he'd just get booed throughout the matches. When Cena would fire up it'd be even worse. When Reigns fires up most people actually like to see the Superman punch and Spear. Cena of course lasted for a decade plus. I'm sure Reigns can do that too. I think Reigns outside of promo work is a way better wrestler than Cena already. He looks cooler, has cooler moves, sells a lot better and works better matches all around. Heck even his promos, I see more potential, because Cena would just make kiddy jokes mostly."

1,The whole movie is unrealistic to an insane degree...I don't know a Caveman being thawed out and awaken seems plausible.,"Encino Man- Robyn would have never gotten with Dave, it was a classic hollywood happy ending. I just watched Encino Man (on Netflix) Staring Brendan Frasier, Sean Astin and Pauly shore and have a real problem with the ending. Dave is obsessed over Robyn, the ""girl next door"", he constantly hits on her even though she has a BF, keeps old photos of when they were kids, and finds any excuse to be around her. Throughout the whole movie Robyn never gives any inclination that she sees Dave as more than just a friend even turning down his ""one phone call"" from jail prom proposal. She is nice to him throughout the whole movie, but it is obvious she is not romantically interested in him. However at the end of the movie when Dave sticks up for Link and defends him being a cave man something is supposed to magically change in Robyn where she loses interest in the free spirit Link, and becomes interested in Dave. Even allowing Dave to kiss her at his pool party. The whole movie is unrealistic to an insane degree, but its a fun little adventure. And for some reason Robyn's change of heart is more unbelievable than find a caveman and his counterpart stuck in ice and thawing them out. It's the classic Happy Hollywood Ending. Robyn should have stayed as a friend to Dave, and the ending could have been his self realization that what other think about him, is far less important on how he perceives himself."

About 2 months later he had a candle burning in his room with the window open. The wind blew a sombrero off the wall and onto the candle. It caught some clothing and part of the bed and the room started to go. It triggered the smoke alarm and I was able to get to it with an extinguisher before the room was fully involved.

Special Guy literally puffs out his chest with pride. I ring up his 15 big cans of dog food, and bag them in his gross smelling bag.

0,Dude that's such a boss story.,"Lol, oooohhh reddit, you shouldn't ask me questions like this. I got necrotized pancreatitis. Woke up with a sharp pain in my stomach, pooped a sleeping pill and went back to sleep, woke up two hours later in intense pain. Called a ride and and hour and a half later I died in the ER. I spent a month in the ICU. It was kinda fun, they gave me some good drugs. I remember singing ""Swing Low Sweet Chariot"" at the top of my lungs. I also didnt like them stuffing the feeding tube down my nose and i kept screaming rape while they did it. The last time i went back to the hospital my nurse walks i. The room and just started hysterically lughing. She explained that she had been one of my nurses trying to get a feeding tube in me and told me that when my mom came in afterwords i was trying to convince her that the entire hospital staff was trying to rape me. The problem was that this time i had just had pretty intense surgery and when she told me the story with all the details i started laughing and it hurt so god damn bad, but i couldnt stop, so i was laughing and crying with pain and hitting the dilauded pump for a solid hour. The entire floor had this running joke that no matter what they did for me i would translate it as rape. Good times. They wouldn't give me any water and I tried to bribe everyone from my sister to the nurses to bring me water. My personal fave was that I tried to bribe my doc with cocaine. Good lord. So some of my roommates at the time were pretty hardcore Christians at the time and when their friends (these girls from the same church) came to visit I flashed them. And when I say ""flashed them"" I mean I pulled my hospital gown over my head and laid there. They still talk to me, mostly with pity tho, lol. I guess I died a few more times in the ICU. When they put a direct line in my heart/chest I ripped it out and nearly bled out. I ended up tied down in the bed and even then i mamaged to get an arm out so they had a damn alarm on my bed that would go off if i shifted my wait too much. I thpught they wpuld turn it off if i kept setting it off but nope, even after i set it off every five minutes all night long they kept it on. I am eternally grateful to those nurses for putting up with me. They had to dope me up with so many benzos I had quite a fun time whenever I could keep my eyes open. I guess I was tripping at points because I remember being tied down to the bed and I thought we were on a triain going thru the mountains and i thought my mom and the doc were having an affair. In fact, I remember calling my dad over and trying to explain that my mom and my doctor were fucking in the bathroom. It pissed me off so much when he started laughing. Fuck, I just realized you probably meant stories about people's reactions to thinking I was dead when I wasn't. It wasn't that interesting, it was mostly the fake people who are always commenting on your shit on Facebook but you know they don't really care about you, they just want to look cool. They posted all sorts of things about favorite memories with me and shit like that, but most of them were either completely made up memories or grossly exaggerated. One thing I did realize was that I don't need a lot of friends to be happy. In fact since this happened I have steadily dropped friends who I don't think would be there in a needy time and I have become much happier. Thanks for listening to me ramble."

It's saying something more like: ""prove yourself and offer something worthwhile and unique to the world, and there you will find more control over your own destiny and passion for what you do."" Or to put it another way: ""look for your passion while you cultivate strong skills, and little can stand in your way"".

Rotations are seemingly pulled out of a hat, guys are playing 14 straight minutes then sitting entire halves, our efficient players barely touch the ball while inefficient guys iso and chuck, we lose any semblance of an offensive system late in games, we turn the ball over like crazy, and our defense sucks. I know we're young. I know it's a long season. But nothing about the way the Denver Nuggets have played this year has inspired any confidence in Michael Malone's ability to gameplan, distribute minutes, or adjust on the fly. He just hasn't done a good job this year so far, even disregarding wins and losses. I'm still rooting for him, but I'm less certain that he'll succeed than I was in September."

As frustrating as it is with conspiracy theorists (I mean I use that term even loosely because, as you mentioned, the extent of research these people do is a bunch of YouTube videos and Anonymous's Facebook feed nonsense) calling everyone who doesn't believe this trash ""sheeple"" and demanding that we ""wake up!"" and ""do research"" is equally as annoying as people who sit on the other side and attack them, saying that they're wearing ""tin foil hats"", that they are ""crazy"" and ""uninformed"". Honestly just let people form their own ideas even if they seem ridiculous. Their crazy ideas aren't hurting you. It seems that with social media everybody is quick to calling each other a *somethingist* and tell others how wrong they are. So what if they're wrong? and so what if someone doesn't believe what you do? It's exhausting, tiresome and pointless to try and convince a stranger on the internet to switch to your side, and it never happens. Basically I just hate both types of people with regards to this."

The way your mind reads a price like $6.75 is ""six dollars plus a little something"". If the post-tax price was shown your mind would read it as ""seven dollars plus a little something"". That difference is enough to cause some lost sales, so everyone does it the first way. Of course, a walking calculator wouldn't be fooled, but a lot of times your brain doesn't work hard enough to calculate things out and just goes with the ""six something"" and ""seven something"" heuristic."

He figured out leprechauns are not real a few months back and the dominoes have just kept falling.

0,Ive played X3 like a bazillion (exaggeration) times and ive never known this.,"TIL If you get the Z Saber in Mega Man X3 without acquiring any buster upgrades you get a non-projectile version of it which charges way faster but still does the same massive damage. Couldn't find this written anywhere online and just tried it myself on 3DS for the first time. I truly hate the buster upgrade in X3. The first shot always comes out slow and forces you to stop dead in your tracks if you're touching the ground, AND the combination spreadshot has very limited applications (it just looks cool for the most part). X2's buster upgrade was so perfect (RIP). So this time I decided to skip it and the gold armor. I am SO GLAD I did. Turns out once you off Zero for his saber without a buster upgrade it now instantly charges as soon as you charge a level 3 shot allowing you to decimate bosses in record time! Its range is very limited and it's not a projectile anymore, but boy it's much faster than suffering through the agonizing seconds it takes to charge up with the upgrade. This may be common knowledge, sorry if it is, but again, I couldn't find this particular detail anywhere else. Just thought I'd share."

0,While I'm no fan of Bo1s (and I hate tournaments without winner and loser bracket as the second best team may very well end up 5-8th) this isn't the reason why a team should fail a groupstage.,"1. They got fucked by Riot (best of 2 format), so the have less games. 2. They can't afford the support staff because they don't have sponsors. 3. In my opinion the best of 1 group format also plays a big role, look at what a shitfest this whole worlds is so far with everyone beating everyone.

It actually sort of worked out well for me, because I needed a flight to San Francisco next weekend for a conference. The best part is that I get reimbursed, so can't go wrong, right? Well, I had to purchase my ticket on October 4th to confirm my attendance, but when I called the Concierge the next day to ask about retroactive credit (because the category doesn't start until today), they said that they could not extended. I even explained that I also have the PRG, and having heard about the announcement on Tuesday and thinking it couldn't have worked out any better, would otherwise have put it on my PRG. I ended up cancelling the ticket thanks to United's 24-hour cancellation policy, but the price has since jumped in the past 24 hours to about $200 more for the transcon. However, the other reason I was pushed to cancel was because some of the logistics around the conference seem a bit sketchy. * They were supposed to contact me 3 weeks out (about 2 weeks ago) confirming my attendance. They did it only two days ago. * They needed a confirmed ticket to SFO as a way to confirm attendance, which I sent them two days ago almost as soon as I received their email. * I haven't received any more email since then. My plan was to book a hotel for the weekend as soon as they got back to me, but since they haven't... Anyhow, I think it'll work out in the end. If I have to pay the higher price for a ticket, it just means more points to look forward to in the future."

1,Seize him guys!,"I love Pebble, but I'm moving to Apple Watch I've worn both the OG and PTR for a combined two years. I fell in love with both of them and soon found myself panicking if I left my watch at home. They helped me drastically reduce the number of times I pulled out my phone and completely erased my ""what if they responded"" anxiety. So when I bought an Apple Watch during a very impulsive binge shopping spree, I figured I'd just try it out and return it. Figured the complaints about the battery life and slowness would immediately turn me off. Well, I was wrong. I fell in love with it, hard. The number of very useful apps for things I already used on my phone was amazing, and I found the health features to be more helpful for me. I'm not saying the Apple Watch is objectively better than Pebble. It's going to come down to personal preference. If you want something basic that stays out of the way and keeps things simple, Pebble is fantastic for that. For me, I appreciate the interaction options with Apple notifications and being able to quickly give input to certain apps. And I've made use of Siri and receiving calls directly on the Watch far more than I thought I would. So Pebble, it's been fun, and I may eventually be back. For now, though, I'm jumping ship. On a side note, I will be selling my silver/white PTR (smaller size). There is a slight scuff on the screen (just looks like a tiny smudge) but otherwise clean. I have both the red leather band (looks worn) and the silver mesh Pebble band. So if anyone is interested, feel free to message me!"

1,Fucking normies,"What puzzles me about r/incels They will make it very clear that they don't like social-justice types. Plenty of people there mock the idea of ""male privilege"" and other basic concepts of the modern left. Yet when you ask them why ""normies"" don't understand them, the usual response goes along the lines of: average men don't repel women, women don't want to admit to themselves they do this, and incels are by definition lonely and disconnected, so they don't show up on mainstream society's view of itself. In short, they are using the theory behind privilege and invisible minorities, that they claim is without merit. I've been asking myself for a while now: is it worth engaging them? I'm sure I can qualify, and I see among them my own worst traits magnified (passivity, fear of coming across wrong, complete blank at society's web of expectations and simply no interest in what passes for ordinary conversation). The odd thing is, there are still plenty of disturbingly misogynistic posts, but the most upvoted comments are the saner ones, suggesting that the place has a demographic of well-adjusted observers (which is not true of any red-pill sub). There seems to be a pattern of: extremists (Caamib, in this case) found the place, it attracts followers who are less committed, they attract more normal people trying to convert the followers. As it is, I'm unsure I can contribute anything. But I wish I could."

The state refuses to pay my medical bills or counseling. 40% of women in Alaska report being sexually assaulted at some point when surveyed, which is double the national average. It's the most beautiful place I've ever been. I've never been happier than when I was there. And I've never been more scared or had my soul squashed harder than when I was there. I'm finally over the PTSD for the most part and am able to make plans with my life without feeling like there's a shadow over them. But he still gets to work as a cop in Alaska if he wants.

0,"The implication that the League balance team should be democratic about when to rework the champions and therefore when they show how they aren't really is supposedly a reason to complain is absurd to start with, who knows their reasons, could it simply be that Nidalee is easier to deal with in terms of balance, or the abysmal low win rate she got a while ago, or just pure bias (which I doubt).",Why does Nidalee get changes so quickly when she is no longer top tier while other champs can stay in the dumpster for an entire season or longer. Does anyone else feel like Riot tries too hard to keep Nidalee in the meta? As soon as she falls off for any reason she is quickly changed to get her back in there. When she was no longer viable in lanes she was QUICKLY retooled into a jungler and now she gets constant changes to keep her stable in the jungle. Can she just be not good for 6 months like some other champs? Why does she get constant changes to stay viable. Why is it ok for other champs to be not good for an ENTIRE season yet nidalee gets constant changes to make sure shes ok. /end rant

0,Cassie Jaye confirmed digital distribution through Netflix and other streaming apps as well as disc distribution (maybe only for Kickstarter backers such as myself),"Honestly I think the best tactic to combat the protests to this movie is digital distribution.

Like pay $5 and you get to watch it as much as you want for 24hr. Point being this movie needs more distribution methods than just these public screenings because those screenings are under attack and antiMRAs are currently thriving on the fact that its very difficult to watch it. It allows them to spread outright lies about it because its so hard to watch the movie and provide a counter argument. Nothing would shut that shit down faster than, ""No it's not and here are clips of the actual movie to prove it."" or ""Show me where that happens in the movie.""."

0,This season is all about late game and having a strong early game solo laner is no where near as valuable as having a late game team fight solo laner on a pro competitive level.,"It depends, having lane pressure is *amazing*, and whoever decides to play Ravana will most likely use that to their advantage by rotating to mid camps to get further ahead, invade buffs and potential ganks in mid. Some teams might try to win like that. Or, obviously, they can play Amaterasu, lose lane, and just win team fights if they hold out long enough. There's not really a factually ""better"" option, it just depends on how things go. As of right now, winning the laning phase and just having tons of map control is something ALG might do, while going for the mid-late game team fights is something LG might go for. Probably. I'm not an analyst, that's just my opinion."

1,"You said ""I'm know there's more"" maybe you should've drafted your post on paper and had a coworker proof read it .","I babysat Kevin at work One of my ex-colleagues is Kevin. At the time, I was around 25 and he was almost 30. It was his first 'real job' out of college. He apparently grew up in a very sheltered, religious household. His dad is apparently a very high-ranking official in the UN. And due to an unfortunate strings of circumstances, Kevin sat next to me: * Kevin had zero computer skills. As a new employee, the company will issue you the standard computer, 8GB flash drive, along with employee handbook, etc. etc. He refused the flash drive because the size was too small (physically) and he believed it won't have any storage capacity. * So he kept having to borrow my flash drive. He also didn't know how to plug it into his computer and kept complaining that the flash drive is ""broken"". * We're an international company with offices in many countries. So, it goes without saying that we all communicate through email. He drafts EVERY EMAIL (even simple replies) on PAPER and then asks me to proof read it before he sends it out. He works as a COPYWRITER. * He asked me if the ""SEND"" button in Outlook means that his email was sent out. * He has more than once got scammed by those Nigerian Prince emails. He sends them his password when they ask for it. * He likes to google my full name (it's not a common name at all. Only I have it.). He googles it often enough that it pops up every time he types in the first letter of my name on Google. One day, he got so excited and showed it to me because I was ""FAMOUS"" because Google knows my name. * Each month, the housekeeper would walk around and issue out tissue paper to put at our workstation. The first time, he asked me what it was. * He drives the cleaning ladies insane by going into the pantry, use plates and mugs and put them back in the cupboard without washing them. When confronted, his argument was that he'll use it again eventually. * He likes to listen in on conversations. More than once, he would ask me what people in five workstations away were talking about. * He stares at people. ALL. THE. TIME. And stare at your computer screen and comment on what you're working on. * He didn't know how to put staples in staplers. When I helped him with it, his reply: ""Thank you so much. I'm just not used to these new technologies."" * He constantly asks people how much their salary is. * His probation period was extended (understandably. he was still asking me to proofread his emails). When HR told him, he threw a tantrum claiming that they can't do that because he already told his mom that he passed the probation. * He often takes his copywriting work home for his mom to check. This is what I can think of from the top of my head. I'm know there's more as he drove me nuts to the point that I wanted to quit and the Head of HR had to console me. I was his designated babysitter for the duration of his time there. People still joke that one day he might come into the office and shoot everyone. I would be the first to go."

You can 'win' in terms of mana and tempo if you have a good follow up but Ooze only really fits into control decks and in control vs control it often doesn't do as much as people think it does even when it destroys a weapon, Atiesh or otherwise.

0,Currently in stat and holy shit this just helped enormously in getting the concept of P tests down,"This isn't that hard. I'm not going to go all hypothesis testy for this, but we can certainly calculate a confidence interval on his measurement. If we believe that p = 1/3 and we have enough data points (which at nearly 300,000 we do), we can estimate a standard error for our measured p using sqrt{p(1-p)/n}. A 95% confidence interval would then be 1.96*se(p) = 0.00086. Given the actual data we can say with 95% confidence that misha's true summoning rate falls within the interval 33.38% +- 0.086% or [33.29%, 33.47%]. Increasing n an order of magnitude to just about 3 million games, would bring the lower limit of our confidence interval to 33.35%, which is above 1/3. We would need about 3 million games to more properly test the claim that Misha might be summoned at a rate higher than 1/3. (at least for p-value of 0.05 and a 2-sided interval, and maybe other things I'm forgetting at the moment.)"

Realising that this is quite a lot of sheep for one farm, and Jess the sheepdog is getting a bit old, he decides he'll probably need a new dog- no, a whole team of dogs- to round so many sheep up. So the next day, the farmer goes to the pet store. He looks around at the various herding dogs- they seem very fit, but young and untrained. The shopkeeper asks the farmer if he wants any help. ""Why yes,"" says the farmer. I need a team of sheepdogs to help round up my flock. I have a rather large number of sheep, you see, and I don't think any of these young pups would be up to the task of rounding up so many."" The shopkeeper says, ""I've got just the thing for you."" and leads the farmer into a small back room, where a single sheepdog sits waiting. ""Are you sure?"" asks the farmer, ""I have very many sheep and I don't think one dog will be able to round all of them up."". ""I'm sure."" says the shopkeeper, ""This is a very intelligent dog. He's been well-trained for many jobs and has skills beyond any other dog I've ever seen."" ""Yes,"" says the dog, ""I know six languages, eight martial arts and I have a degree in engineering."" The farmer, clearly very impressed by this dog- who wouldn't be impressed by that?- decides to take him home.

Family and all that jazz. Well, here are the bullet points from yesterday: - Button is 18 months next week. Does not like long drives. Scream cried the last 40 minutes of the drive. - We started the 2 hour drive around nap time. Button did not nap. On our way, we were told that the dinner planned for 3 was being moved to 6. Because of my sister, L. - Dinner was moved because she was driving in from a few states away and wanted a shower first when she got here. Yep. Whole dinner moved 3 hours. For her. One person. - L was over an hour late from the time she said she would be there. Food got cold. Her husband let it slip to my husband that they went to their in laws (his parents) first for dinner. She held up the entire dinner so she could go to another party first. - Decided to do the ""prayer"" and talked about how she drove all day, had to leave the next day, and was thankful to get to eat all the food and that someone else cooked. - Button did NOT nap. She ate at 6 because fuck everyone else. We left immediately after she got there. She didn't even hardly say hi to me. - If you think I was quiet about this, I wasn't. I told my family that we will not be doing this again. That it was rude and selfish of her and that our daughter was the one who suffers for it. The excuse ""Well, it's thanksgiving"" earned a hearty ""fuck you"" from me. - So from now on, unless it's my Uncle hosting, we are not going. Period. My Uncle gives no fucks and waits for no one. I'm not dealing with her bullshit again. My husband and I also called this. I said that she was going to somehow hijack the holiday, because she always does. - Oh, and I just got a group text from her to my and my other sister thanking us for cooking, saying it was the best she has had in months and how she has barely eaten. Martyr much? Yeah, not responding. - Did I mention I haven't been home in 3 years either? Yeah."

1,Blizzard should also add a trading system so we can trade skins and things like that.,"OverWatch ""LoadOuts"": Is overwatch combat diverse enough? I've had this thought in my mind for a long time now, about how overwatches combat design is very simple. We get to choose a hero, the hero has a kit and you go kill some dudes. It's a good formula, and it works. My idea takes the original idea and builds upon it, Keep in mind these ideas I am presenting don't necessarily have to or will ever have an impact on the current state of the game. That being said I want overwatch to introduce ""Loadouts"". Loadouts would work similar to how the league of legends rune system would work where people could choose how to improve their gameplay through through additional increases in stats or even passive abilities, this would introduce strategic diversity among the champion pools. This would give players more to think of when playing this competitive mode. Example: a loadout could include an increase to the shield power of winston's shield (E) along with more damage with a trade off for less HP and mobility. Perhaps. This is just a basic/rough concept of how it would work, please tell me how it would be broken or otherwise. My other idea was something that came to me when they announced sym getting two different ultimate abilities. My idea takes that further and allows each hero to have two different kits. This gives players more options for their play styles and changes the dynamic of the game. This idea would most likely take up a lot of resources and less likely to happen. And lastly these changes would happen on a different game mode, so as to not effect the original style."

0,"I'd love to see another faction that uses power armor, but with a lot more variation","Fallout Faction Idea This is going to be kind of long so I will add a TL;DR at the end I'm not even sure if there's going to be a new Fallout game out soon but I recently watched the FudgeMuppet video about the ideal Fallout New Orleans and it really got me thinking. One of the things I loved most about Fallout New Vegas was Caesar's Legion, in my opinion they're one of the coolest factions in the Fallout world so naturally I started to think about what, if any, role they would play in a new Fallout game. I think we can all agree on that the Legion ending from NV most likely won't be the canon ending. In my opinion the Mr. House ending is going to be, which leaves the question: What will happen to the Legion? I think the Legion will collapse, whether Ceasar lives or not won't change that. Without Caesar's leadership smaller fights will erupt amongst their own ranks, most likely resulting in the Legion splitting up into smaller groups. Some maybe going back to the tribes they originally were. If Caesar lives, this may take a bit longer. More important though, there will be people loyal to the old values of Caesar and the Legion. These splinter groups will, in my opinion, most likely be pushed out of old Legion territory, i.e. Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico, and further east. Which brings us to the state of Louisiana, and New Orleans (yeah I know Texas lies between New Mexico and Louisiana but ignore that for now. And Caesar's Legion was supposed to be in Texas anyway so we can work something out) So, here's what I'm thinking: Imagine you're exploring the swamps outside of New Orleans when you come upon a town. The town itself is built upon a small lake and held up by stilts which protects it from higher water levels and floods. This town is basically the New Reno of the region. Filled with booze, drugs, stripclubs and prostitutes. You enter the town and eventually end up talking to the mayor, a bartender or whatever. The person will mention something about a raider gang living deep in the swamp outside of the town and you will get a miscellaneous quest to go check it out. When searching for the gang you will travel on a small path through the swamp, when you're getting close to the quest marker a man dressed in rags with a bomb collar around his neck approaches you. He tells you about his ""employers"" and how they have work for you. He assures that you will be greatly rewarded for your services. He then gives you a quest to go and destroy the booze stills, or something in that style, in the New Reno-ish town. After completing the quest you return to the man and he tells you to follow him. The two of you travel down the small path, and coming up at the end of the path is a camp. Outside the walls of the camp there are people crucified, giving you a hint of what's to come. You enter the camp and is greeted by a person wearing weathered legionary armor. He welcomes you to the camp of The Cohort (or The Zealot's, Zealot's of Caesar or something like that, going to be calling them The Cohort for now) and gives you the story of the Legion, and a recap of what has happened since the second battle of Hoover Dam. This person won't be the leader of the faction but merely one in their ranks. He then proceeds to offer you a place in the group, maybe sending you out on a new quest to prove your worth. You continue to work for The Cohort and learn more about them. I want this really powerfull and mysterious character to lead them, sort of a Lanius figure, brutal but more charismatic. He must have other interests besides destruction. As you progress through the questline you eventually get called up to a meeting with this leader. He praises you for the work you have done and tells you that The Cohort has great plans for the wastes of New Orleans. He tells you about the second coming of The Legion, how you and the rest of his men will unite the tribes and towns of the region and eventually march on New Orleans, claiming it for The Legion. The whole idea of The Cohort is to give the player the choice to revive the dying Legion and finally giving it the Rome it deserves. I want them to have very similar values to those of the Legion, such as prohibiting the use of alcohol and drugs, using slaves and having a totalitarian dictator as a leader. They will also use the same roman hierarchy. I have more ideas but I feel that this is enough for now. Let me know what you think and if you want more. Also feel free to comment if you have any ideas to improve on mine! TL;DR I have this idea of a faction that will originate from Caesar's Legion from Fallout New Vegas that I would love to appear in a new Fallout game. Essentially you would be able to give The Legion its rebirth and unite the wastes of New Oreleans/Louisiana, or wherever the game takes place, under its flag."

I feel that there was at least some degree of difficulty in the older games but now they're a joke. Maybe I'm just a overall a better gamer but short of the free legendaries, dumb AI, and being given EXP share at the beginning of the game (which applies to all of your Pokemon) I feel like the series could benefit from a increased difficulty mechanic. This could make trainers more combat aggressive, carry more Pokemon for you to battle against and even removing the option to switch out of battle without missing a turn would be a great start.

One day while I was doing dishes, the 2 youngest kids took him outside and tried to drown him in the above ground pool. Twice. He survived. * My in-laws house was filthy and roach infested. While one of the kids was eating dinner, a roach apparently crawled across his plate, he started hysterically crying. I go to calm him down and one of the others runs into the kitchen, opens every spice she can get get hand on and dumps them all over the kitchen. * I decide I have to keep the two smaller ones with me at all times due to their antics. I put them on the kitchen counter to 'help' me cook. They actually start behaving and I thought I had found a successful method in handling them. I was wrong. One asks me a question while the other takes out glasses from the cupboard and starts smashing them on the ground. I go to stop her when the other little one starts smashing plates. * The two oldest were sisters and they *hated* each other. They get into a fight over the TV (could have been over the xbox, I can't quite remember) the older sister starts chasing after the younger sister, she eventually smashes the younger sister's fingers in the bathroom door. While the younger sister is crying, the older sister is laughing maniacally. That's just a few. There are several other stories that make me so grateful to have moved far away from them all."

I will be going to BMT February 7th 2017 and the field i will be going into is Space System Operations. I will be going for 6 years as i signed my contract already. My questions is what it's like to try to become an officer from enlisted. My end goal is to become an officer in the Air Force and i wish to make this my career.

Think of the MONEY, Hi Rez! All that sweet, untapped and quite sweaty money the furries would give you! Also, adding another generic badass normal character kind of takes away Victor Awesomes of being able to go toe to toe with Witches, Dragons and God Slayers with just an assault riffle and some grenades. So, Hi Rez, learn your lesson, stop releasing generic base female characters with generic kits and instead start releasing more animal-based characters, and you'll basically hit the jackpot."

Ovechkin has 11 to Crosby's 6. * Ovechkin has a case of being the greatest LW in history. Crosby has no case of being the best center in history * Ovechkin has a case of being the greatest goal score in history. Crosby has no case of beng the best in a category (playmaking, goal scoring, hockey IQ etc.) * Ovechkin won all of his trohpies fairly. Crosby won his Conn Smythe based on reputation. * Ovechkin has no help in the playoffs.

Vocalizing your intentions or feelings or anything opens up alternate paths for redundancies and fuck-ups. I know my desired effect, I know how to achieve it, I know there must be sacrifice. There is nothing else. Speaking aloud simply opens too many doors. I want to be like lightning. Find the quickest, most powerful path to my desired intention. In this way mistakes usually turn out to be wonderful lessons as long as you remember there is ALWAYS sacrifice involved in all endeavors. I enjoy the popular notion that you should do good deeds anonymously. Without expectation of reward. Do it for the hell of it. Just do it and walk away. Anything more cheapens the deed."

1,How about just reduce her base AD by 5.,"Camille deserves nerfs - but lets do it right I've spammed the ever loving hell out of camille lately and have just recently hit mastery 7 on her, and I can confirm that she is busted. However I feel like what riot generally ends up doing is just nerfing the base stats or damage of a champ like her until she is effectively gutted. There are less drastic ways to nerf her that will still keep her as a viable pick, but not as oppressive. The main thing with her that makes her hilariously busted in my opinion is her ability to trade for free in lane with little to no counterplay for most opposing toplaners. Unless you are playing jax, poppy, or fiora, camille's lane is almost as abusive as renektons with her also scaling better into the game. The main issue is the q2 prep e-aa-q combo, which can deal an upwards of a third of someones health with absolutely no way to deal with it. So what are the best ways to nerf her? -Increased e cooldown in the early levels by a lot, I feel like a ~20 second cd will keep her ability to trade for free down -Remove attack speed buff on e, its a completely unnecessary stat boost and I'm not quite sure why its there -Make her shield health percentage scale by level, starting at 10% and increasing to 20% These nerfs will serve to bring her back in line without going too far, if she still needs nerfs after that she can get looked at again"

1,"Fortunately, the car analogy is not dead yet!","Thanks for all the answers. Reading about the older IT days is fascinating. I came up in the 90's with early intel systems, I suppose a lot of what I know is done with software, whereas your upbringing was more focused on hardware, because things we take for granted now were more primitive (storage, software limitations, etc). It is kind of like cars. The earlier all mechanical chassis and engine made sense, and could be understood by anyone with a few hours and a basic tool set. Then, there was a transition period to injection, now it's a mess of electronics controlling the engine. Unsure if that made sense, but there it is."
0,"I don't know, pretty sure Lewis just wants to be a kick ass wizard by himself.","I really wish Sjin had a better understanding of what Lewis is doing. Lewis alluded to it in episode 3, but just to spell it out clearly: Lewis has a near-compulsive need to take control. I'm not saying this as criticism, it has made the Yogscast what it is today. But it is *especially* true in a sandbox game when there are various jobs/tasks for people to do. If Lewis stuck with the group, he wouldn't be able to resist taking over and telling everyone what to do. Lewis is going hard-RP because he knows this about himself. This is Sjin's series on Sjin's channel and this is Lewis' way of letting Sjin be in charge. I see this as Lewis showing great self-awareness and I applaud him for it. I just wish Sjin could see it, instead of thinking that Lewis is not helping by running away. Sjin: ""You ran away!"" Lewis: ""I did not run away. I went off on my own because I didn't want to get in your way."""

1,"Nope, record is all that matters, Sun belt is clearly the best!","Why is ""Overall Bowl Record"" considered a useful metric for determining the comparative strength of conferences? Aren't the bowl games chosen to be fairly even? I think the title is pretty self explanatory. it seems that total wins and losses in bowl games is given a lot of importance when it comes to comparing the strength of conferences, when to me it seems pretty arbitrary. Part of the criteria for selecting bowl games is that they will be fairly even, and interesting to watch, right? If Penn State loses to USC, that will count against the bowl game record for the Big 10, yet if Penn State had played worse in the regular season and then beaten an easy bowl opponent, that would somehow count *for* the Big 10 being strong? It just doesn't make any sense to me. I guess I can see how it's some sort of metric of ""overratedness"". I.e. if you are assigned an opponent you were considered to be roughly equal to, and then get blown out, then maybe you weren't as good as we thought. But a measure of how ""overrated"" teams are is not directly related to how strong they are. A conference could be assigned a bunch of weak bowl opponents, beat them, and that might not necessarily mean they were any better than a conference that went even with tougher bowl opponents."

Taking more and more to chase a feeling is a sure fire way to increase tolerance. Katom's effects can vary from day to day depending on many factors, and it seems like the mood lift can be the most variable.

I've often created fun and interesting decks for non-competitive play. I like to try strange decks just to see if I can get them to work. I think it's fun and it's one of the ways I have found to alleviate frustration when grinding ladder. A problem, though, is that I'll make a funky pirate shaman deck or a rogue deck with only two minions, etc. and want to just dick around and have fun with it. I'll go into casual and lose to aggro shaman or control Mage enough times that I feel like I should be playing a ranked deck to have a little more fun, and I'm back to grinding ladder. This brings me to my point. You can choose the class you play against in practice mode, letting you see how your deck fares in certain match ups. I think it would be fun and innovating to be able to choose a deck for the innkeeper to play against you. This could have practical benefits (like a mirror match to test out changes in a ranked deck) or it could be really fun (giving the innkeeper a golden Milhouse Manastorm). It could even be used to mess with deck interplay (thief rogue against a stacked deck). What do you guys think?"

Fernando, Bomb King, Cassie, Barik and Drogoz seem to be from the same ""Medieval Characters with magical hi-tech weapons"" pack, but at some point in development, they forgot about it and said ""Fuck it, we will have japanese elves, russian soldiers and that tree from the other game. - Oh shit, he doesn't have a weapon? Er... give him... an axe? You throw them, but he gets another one out of somewhere. Not to mention the characters are homeless. Why are the some many inca temples in the game? Why does Androxus is trying to destroy Buzz Lighthyear? Why does Sha Lin's bow deal more damage than Kinessa's fucking sniper rifle? Is it because he's asian? I think characters and the world itself has too much of their own and they hardly share characteristic with each other. If you look at TF2, they are all soldiers, fighting. On Street Fighters, they are all martial artists, humanoids and differentiate themselves by their nationality and culture. Paladins is a fat kid with a Naruto bandana on it's head and earphones pumping country songs."
0,Hence why I separated combustability and flammability,"You're partially right. In high school chemistry you learn about ""combustion"" reactions, which involves burning carbon-containing compounds in oxygen. However, this is not the only reaction that controls flammability and there are plenty of compounds that will burn despite not containing any carbon (ammonia, thermite, metal dusts, hydrogen, etc.)."

0,"A difficulty based on distance, the ring-biome mod and void decay would be amazing together as a modpack.","What are your thoughts on a Distance Based Difficulty Mod? One of the classic tropes of fantasy worlds is that the farther you go out into the wilds the more dangerous it becomes. Cities are safe, and the creatures you find near them are weak, but things get harder farther out. Bosses are always in ""the deepest part of the forest"" and such. It's hard to recreate this feeling in Minecraft because the only only factors affecting mob spawning are light level and the occasional spawner block. **There's little incentive to travel farther from your base than you must to find a dark area.** If you want to fight a lot of mobs, the best way is usually to build a spawn room rather than to explore the wilderness. And if you do decide to find mobs through exploring at night, they're basically the same difficulty anywhere you go. So, **what mods can you think of that could fix this?** I don't know of any, but I've thought of some ideas that could go into one: * The most basic mod for this would be to make beds prevent mob spawning within a radius of a chunk or two. * A more advanced one would have mob spawn rates slowly scale up with increasing distance from a chunk with a bed that's in a villager house or from the world spawn until they've scaled up or above the vanilla spawn rate. This would allow you to build relatively safe cities anywhere by placing a bed, but have wild lands in-between * Spawn rate could also be tied to y-level with the spawn rate increasing back towards or above normal as you dig down even if there's a bed/city above to simulate the classic dungeon-under-the-city trope in caves. (dungeons would also be a cool thing to spawn under villages in general but that's another mod in itself...) I'm not a great java coder, so there isn't a large chance I'll be able to make this myself. Any devs who find it interesting feel free to steal anything here. **What are your thoughts?** are there mods that already cover most of this? What other mods can you think of that would force the player to travel thousands of blocks from their base to explore or setup additional bases far away from their home?"

0,All I know is that I wouldn't want to be tunnel-brothers with Derrick.,"Me with girl I wanted to date but she ended up sleeping with my best friend now upset with me because I don't want to date her Wall of text incoming. You can skip to tl;dr but even that ended up being a little long. This is going to sound like a lot of high school bullshit and really it is. Back story is this. A group of friends and mine eat at a local pub once a week during football season and have done so for about 3 years. A new waitress started working there in July (before the season started but we eat there sometimes outside of game day). She was a knockout, beautiful brunette with really blue eyes. She starts waiting our table and she is very friendly. No big deal, its a waitresses job to be friendly so I never think anything about it. We come back in pre-season and she is still there and once again get our table. This time since we are there for a few hours to watch the game she spends a lot of time with us and she talks with me a lot. Now honestly I'm not the greatest at picking up on social cues, I always just assume that the wait staff is just trying to get an extra tip. But my friends in the past have told me I have blown opportunities when they say a girl was hitting on me so I kind of take a leap of faith here and I ask her if I can text her sometime. We exchange numbers and we start doing some very casual texting. Thursday of that week I have a client in town that I have to entertain for the night and well I thought I'd try my luck and see if she was there. Bingo, she's working and take our table all is good. Again she goes out of her way to stick around and talk with us, we came in late so they were closing and she came over and sat with us for awhile. Again I think things are going great. I text her the next day and tell her how happy I was to see her and she returns the feelings on this. Well Sunday comes we are there and once again she is there. Things go the exact same way so by this time I have really started to think that we are both leading towards something and I just decide that after the game I will ask her if she will go out with me sometime. Of course I do this away from everyone so as to not look creepy or anything. She turns me down flat. She say's that I have misread her and she enjoys talking and texting with me but she is not interested in seeing me in that way. Ouch. I'm a big boy, I apologize for misreading the situation and tell her that I won't trouble her again. Hey you swing you miss, it happens. I was not upset other than what you typically will feel when you get flat out rejected like that, but that's just life. A couple of weeks go by and she was not at work for the first game, which if I'm being honest i was a little relieved about. But she was there for the second one. This is when one of my friends ""Derrick"" leans over and tells me ""hey man you see that waitress there, I've been tapping that now for about 2 weeks"". Okay this all makes some sense now, she was just being friendly around me to get with Derrick, it sucks but hey its life. Now I happen to know that Derrick is a real douche canoe when it comes to women, he is a player and he sticks with them a month or two and then moves on. I like him as a guy but bluntly speaking I'm just not that way so it kind of bugs me when he does that because in the past myself and a few of the other guys have been caught in his damatic shitstorm when he runs into a woman who does not take kindly to this. Anyway I just totally put the whole thing out of my mind until about 2 weeks ago. Derrick as I knew he would dumped her. It really kind of upset some of the guys because he did this with a person where we go to frequently so this is going to be awkward for everyone. Sure as shit she is there when we come in but she did not take our table. It was very obvious that she traded off. However at half time of the game she catches me coming out of the bathroom and she starts chatting me up. I reply to her as I would any other time and then I return to the game. Then on Monday I get a text from her telling me how great it was to talk to me yesterday. I just replied back ""good talking to you as well"". That was it or so I thought. Then all of a sudden she starts texting me every day several times a day. Sometimes I don't even reply to her. Then the next Sunday she is once again working our table but she is totally focusing on me this time and pretty much just gives polite conversation to anyone else. Then when we were all leaving she runs up to me as says ""aren't you even going to say goodbye"", which confused the shit out of me. So I told her goodbye and she say's to me ""hey I've been thinking about you a lot lately and I really would like to go out with you sometime"". At this point I kind of had a feeling that this is where this was headed so I just simply told her ""yea, sorry but once someone tells me that they aren't interested in me then I try and move for my own sanity and that the ship had kind of sailed for that"". She gave me kind of a disgusted grunt and turned and left. It's over right? Wrong. The next day I get a wall of text that was fluctuated between anger and apologizing. Basically she said she spoke with Derrick after I rejected her and she found out that I knew about them. She then went into this long rant about how it was wrong for me to ""slut shame her"" for being with someone else when we were not even a couple. How that it was unfair that I really liked her but now that I found out she was with one of my friends that she was ""dirty"". I'll spare you the rest because it was a train wreck with her ending up apologizing for everything she said at the end. I sent back a very short response to her telling her that her dating Derrick had nothing to do with any of it. That her telling me that she did not think of me that way was the reason for all of it and now I didn't think of her that way. She then sent several texts trying to explain herself and ultimately I just ignored all of them because honestly she sounded like a dumpster fire. I eventually just texted her back and said at the end of the day she is an employee of a place I frequent and that is the relationship that we have. This did not go over well so I blocked her phone. Now WTF do I do about this sunday? As far as I'm concerned I've been going there a lot longer than she worked there, we were never a couple so I do not feel like I need to avoid the place. So if she has any form of attitude or badgers me do I tell her manager or should I try and get everyone to move to a different location? It would be one thing if I did what Derrick did but in the end for some reason I'm the bad guy and I've never even been out with this woman but I'm some sexist pig because she slept with one of my friends and now she thinks that is the reason I don't want to date her. tl;dr: Met waitress who was hot and thought we made a connection but I was wrong, she shot me down. No big deal I move on, one of my friends starts sleeping with her and as is par for his course dumps her after about a month. She then tries to hit me up again and this time I reject her, she flips her shit because she say's I'm sexist for rejecting her because she had sex with one of my friends. This was not the reason but now I'm afraid to go to my local pub."

How the translation occurred isn't important, but it was probably technology and stuff and God's ways are mysterious and... uh... well... why are you asking hard questions anyway? Just go to Sunday School and read the teachings of some guy with a beard and how that one time he helped a widow. I mean that obviously makes the church true. No, you can't pass the sacrament or attend Bearded Young University with a beard. I told you, stop asking the hard questions."

She changed on the traditional marriage thing before the primaries, but did keep the build a wall part. watching the primaries, because of Sanders, and watching Trump vs. other for entertainment... I gotta say, HRC and Trump are pretty close in issues. HRC is just a bit more into the money and, probably as a result of looking at the world through the eyes of a secretary of defense for years, more bellicose."

But I've been having some difficulties, and I'll list them off in hope that some of you can help me out... 1. Houses. In my recent game I've had a terrible starvation where 90% of my population died off. As a result, my survivors were scattered across the map. So I closed buildings in favour of bunching my people up to close walking distance. So now all my people are living in different houses close together, so instead of at least adults coupling up everyone decided they needed their own house. So now, firewood was being used at an insane rate to heat all these barely populated homes. Do I have to demolish every single house to prevent this? A feature to 'close' houses would be perfect to prevent this perhaps. 2. Maps. As a noob player I find it frustrating to get maps that are littered with hills and lakes. Perhaps it's like that to make the game more challenging but can we have some maps that are flatter (noob friendlier...) that don't force me to stretch my town across thin valleys and make forester lodges a pain in the ass to place. I know there are mods for this but vanilla features for this would be wonderful! P.S. How does everyone manage to feed their town past the 150 population point? Nothing seems to help for me."

Half of my wife's siblings have left. I know of other family and friends who have serious questions. Is there a trend in the church of people questioning and leaving? If so, how is the church addressing this? RENLUND: We have always seen people come into the church and people leave the church. We are not seeing an increase in people leaving. My SIL was very disappointed to hear this assessment after what he has seen in the family. And hearing of the many people I have seen leave. He noted that some of the talks in conference are sending a different message. BTW, around the Oct GC, he told me I was on the fast track to excommunication.

I bought the same games for my kids and plastic pieces snapped/bent within a month. The TV my grandparents had worked for something like 40 years. In the nonstop quest for saving a few bucks, people have slowly opted for total shit over something that works. I don't blame companies at all for making the crap they do. I'd bet anything they were shocked and confused as people were purchasing wildly inferior products for slightly cheaper than their high quality products. Sure the competitor might look and function the same today, but in a year or two it would fail while the other would keep marching on. Over time it became a race to the bottom, to make the cheapest possible kind of everything. The story above isn't about an evil company, it's about a horde of uninformed consumers purchasing the cheapest crap they can find. I'd bet their sales were slowly suffering, with outlook getting bleaker by the year. Eventually they made the hard decision to not fight the tide anymore."

I used to love him, but it's kinda hard to watch videos about some guy calling something stupid when he clearly doesn't know what he's talking about. For example, the animals video. He mentions how it's stupid that Crocodiles and Alligators are a different species, same for Coyotes, Foxes, Jackals, and Wolves, but that dogs are all the same species. That's not how it works. And in the phobia video, he says that phobias are dumb because being afraid of spiders is rational really misses the point. If phobias are irrational, and something you think is a phobia is rational, *then maybe it's not a phobia*. A phobia isn't not going in your bathtub because there's a spider in there and they're spooky, it's like not going home because there's nobody on guard for spiders and a spider might have found there way in there, even though there's no reason to believe one did or that it'll disrupt anything. That's not all! Then there's the alphabet one, the one with the letters &amp; numbers that mentions vitamins, the autocorrect one all coming off as stupid. And then there are others that while not as bad as those, aren't perfect either. I feel like there's gonna be comments on how I'm being super pretentious and shit, but I'm really not. All I'm saying is maybe don't do topics that you don't know anything about so you look like less of an idiot. PS: I made a throwaway account because last time I saw someone talk negatively about Grade, he raged and hated on the guy, even though he gave polite, constructive criticism.

1,Yeah and I'm sure the tens of thousands of innocent Japanese Christians had it coming too.,"The Real History is the Japanese didn't ""buy-in"" to voluntary extortion white religious imprisonment. Throwing out the white European 'christians' is what lead Japan to close its ports for over 200 years. The Japanese saw the Holy Roman Church was using Jesuits as their exploratory invasion force, with their ""We Come In Peace"" routine. In Nagasaki, there is the site where a barrel the size of a large swimming pool was filled with boiling oil and 38 priests were thrown into that. Scorsese actually gets a lot of reality mixed in with his movies. Several scenes are real scenes in real life, like the scene in Casino where Nicky and his brother dig their own graves in a Kansas corn field, stripped to their underwear and beaten with baseball bats until they were *almost* dead, then thrown into the grave and buried alive. There are news photos from the discovery of their bodies, and Scorcese had the scene laid out just like it happened. He is showing the extremely close relationship of the Mafia with the Pope in his Godfather movies. He seems to be sending the message about how evil the Holy Roman Church has been, so it will be interesting to see how he portrays this pivotal period."

This works well as an occultist along with -20%chaos res. Also, Vaal Pact isn't a great with poison builds like this because you're not scaling the initial hit hard enough to benefit off of instant leech to leech as much as your hp every second. Cospris will matches Shavs in terms of damage actually, as poison is 1 support gem and that roughly translates to 30% more damage (better than PA because you can actually double dip this extra SUPPORT gem) - downside being you have an EVA chest"

0,Thanks for the clarification.,"20 years ago, McAfee antivirus was the best antivirus you could get for free and it was easy to install and uninstall. It did the job, did it well, and didn't mess with your computer. John McAfee, who created it and is brilliant, sold the company for millions, basically retired and ex-patriot-ed himself to do whatever he felt like at the moment (which apparently included lots of drugs and hookers). After he sold it, the company that bought it (forget who) turned the antivirus into a bloated piece of shit which under-performed, and wormed its way into your OS to a point where you basically couldn't get rid of it. This is McAfee's fuck-you to the company that took his product and made his name into a joke in the IT community. In other words, McAfee got based."

1,You sound pleasant person,"It sucks how I can't be too nice to any men. A rant: Backstory: I'm a vendor that's been working with a restaurant for the past 2 years. Workers there come and go but there's an old man that's been there the entire time. Once, a long time ago, he asked me if I would put songs on a mp3 player for him. I told him ~~hell~~ no and that he needed to learn to use a computer himself, to which he didn't like, but I don't care because I can take or leave the guy. The other day I was getting ready to take off and he comes up to me asking me questions (english isn't his first language and like I said, I can take or leave the guy so I just wanted him to go away the entire time) to which I act friendly enough. He starts feeling my arm, saying I must have big muscles, then he starts trying to pull me in for a kiss. I was at work so I couldn't strangle his stupid ass like I would've liked, but I made it clear he's dead to me. This isn't the first time this has happened. Some men just come to the conclusion that I'd have anything to do with them just because I'm polite. And it's not always old men either, guys have beckoned me over for whatever reason and then have leaned in for a kiss *as* I'm telling them I want nothing to do with them. I should just tell them the truth, I'd never consider dating an old man. I think old men are disgusting. They should stick with women their own age. Young women who are into old men have issues or they want their money when they die. Old, broke-ass men that chase after young women are fucking pathetic. No guy, I don't want to get to know you, I don't even want to expend the energy it would take to remember your name. I'd rather go back to before I was burdened with your existence, I miss that, please let me relive that time once again. I swear to all that's holy, I take the time to make myself look as ratchet as possible and I *still* can't get men to leave me alone. I could cover myself with literal feces and will still get hit on by at least one fucking homeless guy. What do I have to do?!? I don't want to assume every man is like that because it's not true. But when I have to look at the ground everywhere I go because merely making eye contact for even one second is enough to get me followed around an entire grocery store (and I see you, motherfucker, you think you're slick but you're as plain as day, do you think I'm stupid or blind?!) what choice do I have but to put up my defenses? I need a really big fucking dog to take around with me or something..."

1,Now that I have a good one they should just drop the rate to 0%.,"Suggestion: 2,000 Phoenix for a named gear saled cache? I think this is a fair option given how low drop rates are on top of the RNG of stats roll. This comes out to 1 cache per 25 Lex Challenging runs (not counting the phoenix coins you can earn from selling the loot and buying basic sealed cache). There are quite a few named weapon/gear out there so there is still a layer of RNG plus the usual stats roll RNG. I understand the point of making the item rare and the ""rewarding"" feeling a player gets when one drops, but the current system is just a painful grind. I know players who have ran lex over 300 times with no Barret Drop or a drop that is absolutely horrible. This scenario is also true for other players who are grinding the other missions for named items. yes i know you can be viable without Barrett.. i've been running reckless + skulls for a while now and I do very well in the DZ. However it is very frustrating to log in and see 90% of your friends running lex and the other 10% just being salty after running lex."

How could she implement it and how effective would it be at saving lives? I think that there are a few issues here: -The SCOTUS, arbiter of federal oversight on local policing, has established probable cause and objective reasonableness, not necessity, as the test for when police use of force is justifiable under the Constitution. I don't know if the President can change that. -Comparative studies among developed countries that show the police killing rate reformers believe the US should aspire to...afaik these countries all have significant structural differences from the US (less untreated mental illness and less driving per capita as well as more provisions to keep guns and even knives out of the hands of troubled individuals). It might be possible that most US police killings are necessary and would occur in France or Canada under the same circumstances; it's just that those circumstances don't happen there as much as there's less driving, meaning less traffic stops and less concern about unarmed suspects squishing cops with 2 tons machinery, as well as better healthcare and better background checks for guns."

They both have balls. Trump has balls to stand up to Washington and be politically incorrect, and Kanye has balls to support Trump. It's not that they ""support"" Kanye now, they simply have a new respect for him and are clearly forgiving which is more than I can say for liberals. But that's typical of liberals.

I was really excited because I remembered the community around the launch of Early Access to be nice, communicative, and overall helpful. The game felt fun. I used to play a lot of MOBAs, and this was a breath of fresh air. In the four games today (Christmas, of all days) I've had three teammates tell me that I'm ""absolute shit"" and to go ""kill myself"". What happened to this community? It feels like a MOBA community (not quite as bad as LoL, but it's starting to have a familiar feel to me) more than it used to feel just like a bunch of people trying to compete yet still enjoying the competition, even if someone is having a bad game. It makes me hesitant to keep at it, and I was excited about getting back into it. :'("

1,Why would I want wards when I can double kill bot lane as support Lux,"What if upgrading sightstone opens up a special slot for control ward Sometimes when i play support and the games drag out to a long period of time, both teams have max items except for the support, who has to empty out a slot for the control ward, and usually gets smashed by enemy adc due to lack of an extra tank item. Some may argue not getting an control ward solves the problem easily, but for a support wards are their only pride they leave on the map as dominance. Which is why i thought, why not giving a sightstone upgrade that grants the player an extra slot **ONLY** for control ward. Or better, a *refillable* control ward. (Might prove^too^overpowered?) I feel that this gives the sightstone a sense of uniqueness with the addition of an upgrade, since sightstone=refillable wards; and sightstone+ = control ward slot (or refillable control wards). Just my thoughts on making a support life easier, helping to get rid of the frustration of a support to keep a empty slot when everyone is full items, and you're just gonna get chunked out while peeling for your adc.

I have been playing the Battlefield series since Battlefield 1942 religiously on almost every platform, but I have to say that I've never seen the level of toxicity as in Battlefield One. Things like EZ and calling people noobs after a close game or heated toxic shouting matches over the voip and chat were not as present in my opinion. For example, I even got shouted at over voip and kicked from the squad because I went for a bayonet change and when asked for the reason he told me I was a killwhore...and went on for three games to annoy me in chat. Maybe I am just imagining things, or maybe I am getting old. I played LoL and Mw3 for a long time, so I am quite familiar with toxicity. However, I just think it hits me more because Battlefield is truly a series close to my heart and hate to see the toxicity coming to the series. Can't remember it during the years of Battlefield."

0,They can do the same thing they have done with the Polaris: publish a coupon that only works if you use a credit card or PayPal.,"What do people think about possibly using the cash only discount option for other sales? I sort of like how they are doing the Polaris sale. Can either pay full price using credit or get the cash only (no credit) discount and CIG gets new money. Unfortunately I don't think the CIG store is structured to do it easily (would need 2nd SKU for everything), but would be interesting if come the Anniversary sale most the ships could either be gotten for 5-10% off if bought with new cash, otherwise full price if using any amount of credit. (note: would also have to modify the CCU system a bit - if get a $100 ship for $90, have to pay that difference in addition to normal CCU cost from one ship to another) It's basically a benefit for people who don't keep cycling their money. Granted it wouldn't help the many of us who have already pledged, but I wouldn't begrudge people this option - helps spur new pledging and the ships won't have LTI. Also the Polaris sale brings up a new interesting feature - the Unique Hull Serial ID. It would be interesting if, since this didn't exist before now, if at the time they lock the cash store near release, they then ran a script and attribute ships to our account chronologically in the order they were purchased, assigning serials as they went. Therefore someone who say got a ship early and kept it will get a lower number than one that got melted than later unmelted or was purchased later."

The video of how Ubisoft downgrades really opened my eyes and even though the Battlefield series is nowhere close I just fear that someday video games will just be entertainment and not art. Dice has done a great job and Im not dissing them, but if somehow they could pull this of I would be extremely impressed."

1,Don't worry they'll get people to repair people's because there's so going to be demand for 100000s of repair people in a given area !,"That's a false conclusion. Two examples that are more local are: the self checkout at many major department stores. One person watching over 6-12 self checkout lanes is not making 6-12 times what one register clerk makes. So even with the labor pricing staying the same there is still phasing out of employees. Another is Walmart laying off 91 people in their optical labs. White collar jobs that require at least some modicum of being above the lowest common denominator are still at risk. The final and less local example is Foxconn. You may remember this company for making the news due to work related stress induced suicide attempts. They just announced 60,000 layoffs. It's a Chinese company and organizations have been outsourcing to China for slave labor wages for decades. Line all of those up. You can't get paid the same always, or you face replacement. You can't be paid above the average because it is work related replacement due to automation. You can't even be slaved to mental collapse. If a job can somehow be replaced by automation, it will. Employee payment has literally nothing to do with it. Lights out factories exist. One or two rooms in a facility where humans regularly occupy the space, the rest of the rooms can be completely dark with no hiccups. Bill gates says society isn't ready for the amount of job loss automation will spur on. This finger pointing to people who deserve a fair and living wage is proof of it"

0,"Did something like this but found out that they will hone in directry to ""vault"" door aka dig the brix out of mountain wall ..","I haven't tested this yet, but I have a defense theory for tunnel defense. It's a theory, so take this with a grain of salt. Start with your tunnel, and go down the tunnel at least 10 blocks or so, preferably deeper. In fact, deeper would be better, but a minimum of 10 blocks in. Dig yourself a pit, using the tunnel as your center, about 3 blocks to both sides, about 8 blocks down the length of the tunnel, and maybe seven blocks down (lower is okay). Reinforce that pit with the best materials you have, because it's going to take a lot of damage. Now, build an iron ledge on the side of the pit where the tunnel leads to your base, maybe two blocks out. This is to protect against the spider zombies and to put you roughly in the middle of the pit. Build a temp bridge so you can cross to the tunnel normally... you'll be removing it during the horde. At the bottom of the pit, cover it in spikes, the best you can make. You'll be replacing these after each horde, guaranteed, so don't get attached to them. When the horde hits, remove the temp bridge, and wait for them to show up. Stand on your iron ledge, and watch them shove each other into the bridge. They'll start taking damage and tearing everything up, including the walls, but you should be high above them as they are roaming around. Let them build up down there for a little bit, and when you think the time is right.... drop bombs on them. Fire is also quite useful, I'd think drop both down there. With the bombs, fire, and spikes all doing their work, even the strongest zombies are going to have a bad day. If flyers manage to get in, you'll be able to back into the tunnel and fight them with melee. This setup will likely leave ferals alive, you'll have to shoot them to death, but you should be safe while they struggle in the pit. Cops will likely try to snipe you from across the tunnel, but they're going to be getting shoved into the pit from the other zombies or shooting their fellow zombies in the back, and you can gun them down from a distance... now that I think of it, putting a defensive barrier of some sort to hide behind would be a good idea. Give it a try, I'm curious how effective it is. I'm going to be trying this when I start my new game next week."

Everything is going well, I have annexed naxos, still hold negroponte, and still hold crete. I had to give up Durazzo and Corfu in a past war with the Ottomans. I am pursuing relations with Cypress, with the eventual plan to annex them and have major trade control. While things might seem fine for now, until i have to go to war with the Italian nations, war with the Ottomans is looming. They have a core of Negroponte, Naxos, and Crete, all major points of trade for my nation. I have a great relationship with Austria and Hungary, as well as the papal states, Im afraid that the Ottomans will go down and try to take full control of Greece before even attacking the Hungarian front. Should i start building up forces on the islands of Naxos and Negroponte? Should i produce a better navy to blockade my islands in case of war? Is is even worth it? Should I just give up those islands if war was to happen? I feel like my nation is backed up on a few islands in the Ottoman's territory and there is not much i could do, as the Ottomans have a better navy than me. Please help, as i think losing those provinces would give me a major loss on trade income. Thanks!"

0,How is that hypothetical consumer accumulating $1000 in the first place?,"I'd fall into camp 1. However what you've excluded in your reason is the third party here. This was covered by Henry Hazlitt originally. But I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere else here. With the coming of machines a massive supply of cheap labor, this will create bidding wars among corporations (Assuming they're operating in a free market) which will in turn drive down prices on the products themselves. This won't be instantaneous, but only after the corporations regain the capital spend on converting to machine labor. The savings on labor will eventually be passed onto the consumer. This consumer who used to pay $1000 to his tax accountant can now get the exact same work done for $25, and in a tenth of the time. All of a sudden he's got $975 that he's free to spend on other products or services, which in turn may employ more machines, or more people. The other great fallacy that hasn't been addressed (and most of the comments in this thread seem to pivot on)- There is no cap on productivity. There is a cap on employment; and that's 100%. But as we develop greater technologies that enable us to do more of the things we do and at faster speeds than what we used to do- net productivity is increased and the net wealth of the world is increased. Let's say the machines truly do corner the manual and services industry. They're not only working our fields, they're managing it. They're our lawyers, stock brokers, accountants, historians, scientists, programmers, etc. This won't leave the world of humans unemployed. We'll be looking at the greatest boom in niche markets, the likes of which we've never seen. We'll be freed up to become painters, filmmakers, story tellers, musicians, sculptors. Free of menial labor, mankind's creativity will be unleashed. When machines put people out of work, I personally look at it as a GOOD thing. Not in the short term. I'm sure it sucks not knowing how you're going to feed your family, and my heart goes out to anyone in, or who has ever been in that position. But in the long term, in the greater scope of humanity; the world is better off. We're on the verge of the greatest revolution of mankind. Not only a machine revolution; a cultural revolution. Every individual will be free to follow their own dreams and aspirations, where creativity knows no limits."

The entire first gen really needs to be retouched and refactored badly which should include some reimaging from the concept artists. Beyond that we have all of the ships that have been sold that haven't been made yet. There were a few bursts of ship releases early in the year but that has slowed down tremendously with the patch rate in the last half of the year. Honestly if they want to crank ships sales out like this they need to separate ship drops from major patches. It's been nearly 3.5 months since 2.5 dropped and we got the Reliant and the Argo. In the first half of the year we got 6 new flyable ships. Which makes this last six months a slower rate of ships coming down the pipeline.

Every time the topic of scooping, the identity of Eggs, or the ending to the game is brought up, people immediately start reciting, ""You can't survive scooping!"" But why does everyone assume so? In truth, we don't actually know what happens when a human gets scooped. Nowhere in the game is it clarified, so don't go trying to pass speculation as fact. In reality, the only piece of evidence we have is that Ennard tells the player that, ""You won't die."" (side note: the final cutscene monologue's meaning is still up for debate, so whether or not it turns out that Michael believes the scooping should have killed him is unknown) Whether or not Ennard is a trustworthy source is arguable, but the possibility that scooping a human really doesn't kill them can't just be outright dismissed. Indeed, the only human we're aware of to be scooped, Eggs, survives. There might be some piece of actual evidence I'm forgetting, but it seems right now that a few people started saying that no one can survive scooping in order to make the events of the game agree with their headcanons, and now that there's evidence to the contrary, there are still a ton of people who still treat this speculation (albeit, reasonable speculation) as fact."

He not only endorsed her, he campaigned for her and against third parties. Had he been a true progressive, he would have accepted Jill's invitation to join forces with her and run on a truly progressive platform - that could have won a plurality of votes. And now he wants to ""save"" the Party that denied him the nomination and that now is in a shambles. What a waste. We need to build a new progressive movement outside the duopoly and be wary of ""leaders"" who can be so easily co-opted as Sanders was. He is an Independent in name only - he is really a committed Democrat, committed to a Party that has no credibility and no future."

No, I don't hate Civcraft because I do play fairly often and I've made quite the bunch of friends there. I've seen development yet it was very slow. But this ain't no complainin post about Civ. This is my post about appreciating devoted for what it is. So even though I just started devoted and I knew right from the start when 3.0 of devoted launched that the experience would be amazing and I wasn't dissapointed. This server is great.

Personally I'm dumping all my NRG every waking moment of the day into this event till I can get to 12k points for the trust moogle. I'm not a whale so I'll probs aim for under Rank 10,000.

0,Fair enough on the criticism and I agree with your sentiment towards body autonomy but the government already does limit autonomy.,"No, of course not. I have seen a fair share of crazy liberal feminists who believe that women are entitled to everything because they are women, but I have also met plenty more women who work their ass off and achieve everything quite fairly. Now, the minority of women who support the *my choice* abortion are those who are, quite frankly, crazy. Again, those are the 'fringe' parts of liberalism. Classical liberalism is nothing like that. They believe in both rights *and* responsibilities. I am not even a liberal, I am a conservative and so I feel that all men and women should be free to do as they please with their body. The concept of body autonomy is essential to the functioning of human rights. If we do not have body autonomy then everything else falls apart and we certainly should not have the expectation that everyone will defend their freedom with the barrel of a gun because that's not how one should defend their freedom, unless absolutely necessary. Anyway, I think I am digressing a little. Don't use an internet forum as a barometer for what women think, especially two chromosomes. That place is an effective safe space, much like coontown or fatpeoplehate used to be. Plus, a lot of women think that 'being a man' is about acting like a dick and, so, a lot of young feministas basically act like that to try look 'hard and cool', like teenage boys.

Really tired of the old ""it's casual I do what I want"" attitude of some players but I also can't justify sitting in q for 10 minutes, 10 minutes of picks and bans, and then a 40 minute game for ranked. Adding an actual semicompetitive q would split the player base tho, but honestly they could drop a few game modes that they don't update, balance for, or put at the bottom of the list where no one can even fucking see it to q Just a thought from a player that doesn't want the commitment or stress of ranked, but does want the competitiveness/giving a shitness of ranked"

Open theism simply claims that at least some of our choices are free in a libertarian sense (that it was possible for us to have done otherwise), and that God can't foreknow a libertarianly free choice because such knowledge is logically impossible: there is currently no truth value about what libertarian free choice I'll make tomorrow.

0,Keep the dog dump the dude is the only answer dog owners ever need.,"SNW and the engagement BIL Hey gang! I found time to write a bit so here it goes! Remember BIL is dating now SIL and he's now thinking of marrying her. We were sitting in the room at the il's house just us three. BIL is talking to DH about it. SIL has a dog that she's had for years. It was a gift to her by her father when he became very ill, near death. The reality hit him that life is short and he decided to start making good on some of his promises before he died. He always told SIL he would get her a dog, they were a military family, and he'd always say the next place we move I'll get it for you. So he got her this dog at that time and she loves her dog and he has sentimental value to her. Now, BIL has not yet met this dog because you know it's serious when you meet the dog. BIL sates to DH: Well the dog has to go. I have allergies and I can't be living with a dog. I know the dog has sentimental meaning for her because of her dad but my health is more important than a dog. She's waiting for me to meet the dog because she wants him to slowly warm up to me. This is stupid, it's just a dog... I don't see what the big deal is. I want to marry her but if we get married we'll already have to get an apartment and that costs money there (both of them at the time were living with their parents and would meet each other for dates and such). If we keep the dog then we have to pay extra money for pet rent and I'm not paying extra money for a dog!!! DH is just nodding his head and listening (he's pretty laid back and quiet always like this guess it's true opposites attract). I'm thinking how rude is this guy? He wants to marry her and is supposed to love her but can't have compassion for what she loves??? I know he's SNOT JR. For sure. Anyway he meets the dog and they get engaged. They have all these big events that I find my way out of because I can't stand being around them. They had a family celebration right after he proposed and a joint couple shower. SNW knows how creative and crafty I am, especially after my wonderful diy wedding decor, so she asks me to help her decorate for the rehearsal dinner. I reluctantly agree to help her. DH and I have been married over 3 years at this point. SNW has never made any efforts to call, text, smoke signal, or communicate with me in any way or form any relationship with me. Can't remember if I posted about this before but I did invite her to an event to be the bigger person, but she basically fought me even giving it to her. The event was based on a book and I wanted to buy her the book and put the tickets inside as a Christmas gift. She was like oh I don't want a book. And then proceeded to text DH about how she doesn't want whatever I'm trying to get her, that he knows the type of gifts she likes and to stick to that. I was so angry... I was raised knowing when people get you a gift you accept because the person thought about you and took their time to get it for you so be grateful! Guess not everyone learned that. I still invite her after my moms advise but said well I was trying to do this for you but since you didn't want it I'm asking you now would you like to go with me. Then she's like oh I would love to go I had no idea thats what it was, super nice in front of everyone. We went to the event and she straight up did not talk to me the whole time and went off in her own during the intermissions. Sorry for going off topic but you get the point. Now all of a sudden she's blowing me up about this wedding rehearsal. She texts several times a day and calls about her ideas and sends me pics. She's always like Hi how are you then goes for what she wants... I'm not fooled at all, she never cared how I was doing for over three years. She says Oh well SIL and I have been talking about the plans and blah blah blah. Basically trying to run in my face that she talks to SIL all the time and she's being involved in the planning. unlike with my wedding, but that's because she got mad at me for not doing what she wanted and did CBF the rest of the time I was planning. I tell DH about this sudden change of behavior and how much involved SNW is in this wedding as compared to ours. He suggests well maybe because she has a good relationship with SIL she realizes she needs to do better with you and this is her way of reaching out to you... I say maybe but I know its all fake..."

My top three: 1) Mysterio - my absolute favorite villain in the entire marvel universe. I would want a classic version of the character, fish bowl and all. Can you imagine how visually appealing his skills would be since they're illusion-based? I don't know if it'll ever happen, but here's to hoping. 2) Wonder Man - Another one of my all-time favorites. I'd love to see Wonder Man in this game, especially with an ultimate style costume where he's basically living ionic energy. 3) Nova (Richard Rider) - cosmic heroes are extremely cool and Nova feels far overdue, especially since the Nova corps are in the game. Honorable mention: Howard the Duck - Quack-Fu. That is all."

0,"As a fun Sunday school lesson: now kids, lets figure out how many kitties and how many puppies drowned in the flood...","Well, there is also the problem of how Noah and his family and all the animals survived after the flood. According to genesis the flood lasted 'forty days and forty nights"" Does this mean forty whole days of rain and forty more rains that occurred only in the evening? Then the ""fountains of the deep opened up"". Whatever the fountains of the earth are...aquifers? geysers? It does not specify. We are supposed to picture a whole lot of water. It covers up all the mountains. Noah, his family, (just eight adults), and all the animals slosh around in this boat for quite some time. The ark is not huge by any means. 50 cubits by 300 cubits with a height of 30 cubits. This strikes me as an incredibly narrow boat. Cubits are about 22 of our inches. Anyway. After Noah and his kin get washed around in this mountain covering flood for one hundred and fifty days they come to rest on top of a mountain. They get out. What then? A flood that bad would kill off everything. They would have no animals to eat, the land would be silted over, even if they did bring seeds it would not guarantee results. A person who in this day and age can actually believe that the bibical flood happened as genesis states can be made to believe anything. Any lie, any bit of propaganda, any advertisement, any politician's spiel. They will eat up bullshit with a spoon and think it tasty because their powers of reasoning has been suspended. For me the worst part of the whole noah story is it is fed to small children as a nice bible story. I recall vividly the Sunday school classes with little kids drawing away with crayons all the animals. It has animals in it! Kids will love it! Just don't let them think of all the new babies drowning, all the small children, and all the other animals that did not get to represent their species. Noah is truly an ugly story."

Additionally, an 8-day mission is completely different than a 2.5 to 3-year mission. Maybe if the em drive pans out, but even then there are significant unsolved challenges. For example, the lunar Gravity is about 1/9 that of earth. Martian is about 1/3. The amount of fuel needed to blast off from Mars is significant.

1,But the stats say our defense is top 10,"Living in the past, again, forever into the future I posted this in the offseason, looks like it's playing out perfectly again. Last year I was so hyped, and we all felt the same for good reason. Team had played well before...if Randall and DMC could be ok, and if our defense could be just as good as it was (not very good) then there was no reason to think we wouldn't be a pretty damn good team with a nice shot to do well in the playoffs! I remember posting on here, that NOTHING matters if Romo goes down. Well low and behold, Romo goes down and our team falls apart and we have the worst season in recent memory. Our defense was about as crappy as we felt it would be, our running game was pretty damn good as we hoped it would be. So w hy did we suck so hard? We can't close out teams, and even in 2014, we haven't been able to close out a team with our defense for damn near as long as I can remember. In 2014, Romo got us leads and Demarco closed them out. And if that didn't happen, we could always count on Romo to bring us back and give us a chance for that FG or game winning TD IF we got the last possesion. Please note that's our offense: getting us leads closing out games and/or bringing us back from the brink. Our defense rarely ever makes game changing plays when we need them. Because this teams defense SUCKS DICKS at closing out games when we have a lead. I had a feeling that every time we are up by less than 8, and the opponent gets the ball in a situation where they will have the last possession, we're done. We cant' get any pressure on the QB, and in no huddle 2 minute drill it's just way to much pressure on our extremely below average defense to hold onto that lead. We saw it last year in OT 2 times. Neither time did the offense even get on the field and we lost. Reddit and PFF to the rescue here is the data since 2011 in the scenario where the Cowboys are either tied or ahead by less than 8 with 4 minutes to go in the 4th quarter. Dallas has allowed the most TDs in that time with 12. The Vikings have allowed the most total scoring plays with 21 Dallas has lost more games than any other team in the league in this scenario with 15 losses since 2011. That's out of 31 opportunities, which is 48.39% of the time. That's almost a full season worth of losses because our defense can't stop the opponent when it matters most. and in that time, Dallas has the worst percentage of all NFL teams. So with all that being said, looking at our current roster, what reasons do I have to believe our defense is better now at getting press ure and sealing wins. With Romo, there are games we'll win even though the defense gives up points at the end of games as long as there is SOME time left for him to use his magic. But if he goes down, and he probably will at some point, we're doomed. I do believe if we have Romo, and Elliot playing well that we can close out games using our offense, but that's such a damn risky proposition.

0,Agree with a lot of this but if you're replacing Curry with a star guard why not replace Draymond with a star big man,"I think you can both be right. It's Curry in the sense that it's his team. The system doesn't function if he's not there, and everything's been built to account for his overwhelming offensive presence. It's Draymond in the sense that he's the pillar of the system that makes everything flow and allows us to run so many good lineups on the floor. I think if you replace Curry with another star guard (anyone as good as Westbrook/Harden down to Walker or Thomas) we're still the best team in the league. If you replace Draymond with a standard PF we don't go 73-9 and we probably struggle in a Bo7 against Cleveland or the Clippers"

A 20Ah bank at the proper voltage can last more or less than 13 hours depending on the voltage of the bank.

Take Ronin for example, the sword titan. Often, he states ""We are stronger together, pilot"" and it's true. With his processing speed, algorithms and logic combined with a humans intuition and risk/reward assessment (robots err on one side or the other, a human does not) they can make combined decisions leading to the best outcome. Also. A human can sacrifice themselves, a titan cannot sacrifice their pilot. Alone they are formidable, but together, they are only challenged by an equal."

Toppings consisted of any ingredients (usually going bad, or something that wouldn't last the night) that could weigh the dough down so it didn't bubble up too much in the oven, which would have rendered the cleaning process less effective. The result was given away to the poor or sold at a very low price. By their nature, pizza toppings can be anything that weighs down the pizza dough and is somewhat edible."

While my character pumped the shotgun he turned around, and I shot him again, this time even closer and with my crosshair on his chest. No hit marker again. Then he headshots me with an AR before I could shoot again. And finally just now, when I had a medium range encounter with my AK. I held down the trigger and actually did a surprisingly good job of keeping the crosshair on him, because I'm usually pretty bad with the AK.

It was put in there to incentivise people to get the game sooner than later, but it's just a waste of resources and time. I played the first 3-4 of them and then I didn't care, and when I found out you can literally DIE and restart before the game goes back, I saw zero point in doing them, as it ruined the tension. Contracts on the other hand, are amazing. I know many probably ignore them, but it's what kept me playing. It's amazing to outwit a fellow player with knowledge of not just the level but the game mechanics, and twist them. Nothing comes close to this. The issue is, the contract creation is too limiting. We should be able to adjust things more and maybe give people more of an incentive to play contracts."

If they have no objections, then I will now appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court."" Garland goes and tries to hear court cases an act as a Supreme Court Justice from then on out. What would be the reaction? Immediately obvious would be *substantial* push back by Republicans in the Senate, and such a disagreement would likely lead to the nuclear option and an end to Democratic filibusters. But that might happen regardless of Obama's actions. Would the other Supreme Court justices accept Garland, or refuse him? What happens when Trump comes to power and tries to replace him?

1,yep just like pc gaming,"Is Airsoft Dying? So this is a topic that isn't really covered to much but I feel it needs to really be addressed. I've seen a bit of people on YouTube and other social media platforms talking about it so here is my take of it. Atleast for me at my local field it seems like there is less and less players coming. That itself doesn't mean to much because it's just one field but after talking to my friends, even some from out of my state, most if not all said that their local fields are also not getting as many players as the used to get. Does this mean Airsoft is dying? No not at all it just means that it is expanding faster than the current player base can handle. Back in 2012 there was a huge spike of new Airsoft players and a bunch of new fields and Airsoft retailers and manufacturers opened up. Fast forward 4 years and it has leveled back out to its normal rate of players. All of those manufacturers and fields are now hyper splitting the Airsoft community to give the illusion of less players. That is also the reason why we saw a lot of Airsoft manufacturers go out of business because they expected that huge spike to keep going but it leveled out instead of rising more. Airsoft as a whole isn't dying it is just being hyper split across more and more fields. In a few years a bit of fields will go out of business due to the hyper split player base but that will bring larger numbers back into the other fields and the whole spike in player base and hyper splitting will start all over again."

0,To add to this there are also various Root apps that can tinker the time to turn on doze mode.,There are two types of Doze in Android Nougat. 'Light' Doze and 'deep' Doze. 'Light' Doze is triggered as soon as the device's display is turned off. It limits battery drainage somewhat but still allows most background services to sync. 'Deep' Doze waits for around 30 minutes after the last movement before engaging. It disables all on-the-fly syncing and bundles it together in 1-2 hour intervals. This is from my recollections of changelog articles when Nougat developer previews came out early this year.

1,But drugs are scary and bad and the momma government knows what's best for me.,"Produce all drugs in the US with proper QC controls (the lack of which kill a lot of heroin addicts for example) and sell them only to adults and with taxation. Use some of the taxes to fund treatment programs for adults who want them. This will put all drug gangs out of business and greatly reduce crime. The concept of treating grown adults as idiots when it comes to intoxicants is relatively new and grew out of that other failed experiment, prohibition of alcohol. Ideally no-one would use drugs or use only the more innocuous ones like weed and mescaline - people should be able to make that choice themselves without funding criminals and without further risking their lives over QC issues and with vast amounts of extra taxation for the government which could be put to good use."

I went on Paltalk (if any of you remember what that is, it's a voice-chat-room client) and started arguments against Christians and the sort after watching Ahmad Deedat and the works. Then one day an atheist (who's name passes me) asked a simple question: **Here's the argument:** When the devil disobeyed god, god damned him. Damning, meaning the devil will never be allowed into heaven. Then how the hell did the devil sneak back into heaven to trick Adam and Eve? Was God unaware? Was he too weak to guard his borders? What kind of God can't back his own word? This is where I started to logically question all the things I was told, the stories always fell apart when you applied logic. Now, I'm not sure if that particular story has an actual answer or if it is solid. Was the devil waiting for his damnation to be processed by bureaucratic angels? Who knows? But it set something off in me, and I thank those people for making good logical arguments (even though they were pretty snobby and rude about it). It was worth it in the end."

Maybe its just me but when I meet someone who doesn't have a passion I tend to assume they are shallow and don't think deeply. Any reason why women tend to not have hobbies and what do they do with their time and mind for that matter?"

The game really made me realize how much people will want to take advantage of you and use you any chance they get, but that by believing in yourself and in those you trust you can reject what is thought of as ""normal"" or ""right"" and do what you believe in. Even though some may think that what you do is abnormal or unusual, what matters the most is that you have confidence in yourself and in what you are doing. I've really gained a lot of self-confidence after playing this amazing game as well as become more aware of the things I feel are wrong in society around me.

Archer tower already sent an arrow, and cannon thinks ""Mmm, MP is going to die from this arrow, (and i am so lazy), i wouldn't shoot"".

0,You can stand up for what you believe in and still be at one with reality.,"I have a few philosophical and otherwise questions. The first one is: do you want young people to follow their dreams and stand up for what they believe? Or do you want them to be educated thoroughly until they have the correct opinion? These two options come in conflict to one another and you know it. So, do you think people should have the courage to stand up for what they believe in, or should they always question themselves and their knowledge? The second one is: do you think people should have the courage to express themselves and their opinion no matter what, or do you think they should ask first what the correct opinion is and then just express that? Somebody told me that I should always express myself and I should always vote, even if I'm not popular, especially if I'm not popular. If I refuse to express myself, I will be underrepresented and then nobody will take me seriously because I hadn't expressed myself. But I don't know what to say or think about this. Anyways, these questions are very important for me and my religion. They are very important. They are extremely important for me and my religion. So, should I stand by my convictions and post my conviction wherever I can and try to persuade people, or should I first inform myself and then ask people nicely if I'm allowed to speak?"

It could be the entire team jumping on the Widow-hate bandwagon, even if the pick is completely justified. I recently saw a YouTube video with a guy wanting to go to 3500 SR and only wanted to play Soldier for the day. In a game, people gave him shit and told him he wasn't doing well, even though he had gold damage and elims, which are the only ways for them to gauge his performance. Now, of course, Soldier might not work because of the enemy comp, and if they'd said that, fair, but they told him to switch so *someone else* could play Soldier and do it better. And the entire team jumped on that. Not because they needed another hero instead of Soldier, but because they had somehow gotten it into their heads that the only reason they were losing was because of the gold Soldier being bad at Soldier. And that was enough for them to bully and moan the entire match. It was one of the stupidest things I've ever witnessed."

And it's designed to fit comfortably at the current aspect ratio with the friends list basically sitting to the side of it. To get super real with y'all, we've had a few people saying this whenever they get access to the alpha, but we think it's mostly just because it's a change from the legacy client, and we're expecting it to die down on its own.

No healthy prepubescent kid performs sex acts on other prepubescent kids. That's not how we're built; sex drives kick with puberty, not before it. Children performing sexual acts on each other is far from healthy for either kid and is known as ""child on child sexual abuse"" for a reason. What Lena did is undeniably fucked up. Now, *that said*, I *do* agree that children don't naturally sexually abuse other kids, and so I assume that something happened to Lena to fuck her up badly enough that she would think that her behavior was ok. And now that I've said *that*, I still hate Lena because she acts like what she did was acceptable. Lots of people did shitty things when they were young, but they *acknowledge* that their mistakes were mistakes. Lena acts like her abusive behavior was acceptable, and *that*'s why I think she's a shitty person."

I'm not putting the blame on Singer or Apocalypse or anything really other than the entire franchise has kind of become tedious and the characters aren't exciting anymore. Deadpool and Quicksilver are the only two characters in the entire franchise that hold any interest for me personally, and they aren't enough to prop the whole thing up. Wolverine wasn't enough to prop the whole thing up from the beginning, but they got as much mileage out of him as possible and now it's time I believe for the whole thing to go into the vault for 5 years and then go full reboot with a whole new cast of actors playing the X-Men. As far as a new arc to reboot the franchise with? I'd be happy to see Broodfall on the big screen."

Katie Ledecky just destroyed a ton of her own world records, winning 4 golds and a silver at age 19 in Rio. Phelps had the greatest career of any Olympian by far. But Mark Spitz, Missy Franklin, Ledecky, and others have shown that winning 5ish golds in one Olympics isn't a unique thing that only Phelps could do. I could maybe see some future swimmer surpassing Phelps, as he surpassed Spitz's 7/7 golds (tho Spitz set a WR in each of the 7 too)."

I can't believe you would be so insensitive to his distress, smh.","TIFU by pretending to be a mannequin Like so many others this didn't happen yesterday, but a few years ago when I was in college. I was working in a sunglass and lifestyle store when I got bored and decided to cover myself from head to toe in snowboarding gear. All the way from pants and jacket to gloves, facemask, goggles and hat. Not a single piece of skin was showing. I goofed off in the store for a bit and then decided to go stand in the big glass front window. This is where the FU happens. I am standing in there as still as can be and getting a couple of weird looks but nothing too strange. For the most part people aren't noticing me. Then a little kid (maybe 12 years old) comes right up to the glass and stares at me, obviously noticing something isn't right. That's when the practical joker in me takes over and I throw my hands up and scare the crap out of the little bugger. He runs off half scared half laughing and I leave the window display and get back to actually working. A few minutes later an older fellow comes in and says he saw what I did and that it was incredibly racist...ohh, I didn't mention that the little kid was black, because to a normal person they wouldn't even think in those terms. The older fellow was black too. He goes on to tell me that he's a professor at one of the Ivy League colleges across town and that he studies this kind of stuff regularly and that what I did was incredibly racist. He lectured me a bit more, and I just stood there and listened since I was so caught off guard then he finished by saying that it was because of people like me doing that kind of stuff that black people were afraid of white people. TLDR: pretended to be a mannequin. Scared a little kid who happened to be black. Got called a racist."

0,"Good info, and i'll keep all of this in mind :) thank you!","You and your friend learned a valuable and important lesson about Dark Souls invasions. The best thing to do is to go *all out* when you get invaded. Any good invader will come into your world fully prepared to give you the hardest time he can. It would be disrespectful to resort to ""honor rules"" and not do the same. Ganking an invader IS honorable, if you're co-oping. These are some other things I would suggest you can do to ""gank with honor"", take whichever ones you like the sound of: * Bow or wave when you meet the invader, and bow after you beat him. NEVER Point-Down after you beat him, Point-Down is equivalent of saying ""fuck you weakling"", Applause is equivalent to ""good job idiot"", be good sports instead. * Never disconnect on purpose to avoid being killed. Ideally, don't suicide either. * Stand your ground and fight one-on-one if your friend is killed in the 2 v 1, don't run away to re-summon; although, having your friend put his sign near where you're fighting might be an acceptable middle-ground, as it still allows you to co-op and it is not cowardice. * If the invader runs to hide behind enemy mobs, pop a Seed of Giants and then rush to continue fighting him, instead of hiding where it's safe (such as by the bonfire). Popping a Seed in response to his action is probably more honorable than popping it the moment you get invaded just as a ""precaution"". * FIGHT PROPERLY. Don't R1 spam him down, don't parry-spam him, don't rush him in a straight line, DON'T TURTLE. Honor the invader with your best work; engage him with ruthless, calculating plays that make you stand out from the rest with your skill alone. Flank him on both sides, set him up for a team stunlock, punish any of his plays you see that are bad. Show the invader that you two are not chumps that will lose a 2 v 1, make the invader admire you even though he was killed. Again, *bow afterward.* * If you encounter the same invader multiple times (and he's not rushing you down on sight), consider dropping him a gift! Even a stack of Green Blossoms will make any invader smile, you have no idea how quickly we burn through them! If he's one of the cool ones, he'll leave you a gift back, and now you've made a new friend. Those are just top-of-my-head ideas! I definitely believe ganking with honor is a thing though, and that both the host's team and the invaders can be allowed to enjoy Dark Souls at the same time. Just work to make invasions fun and not stressful. You're definitely right though, ""tooth-and-nail"" is what the majority of co-opers go through, invasion or not. I think a lot of ""young players"" that invade miss the point, and the onlookers who watch YT videos of ""invaders owning gankers"" and have no clue what all the social newaunces mean, even moreso. Don't give up, you two! I promise you your plight is understood and that the one who sent you that angry message was one of the ""young'uns"", and he's going to either learn his lesson himself or move on to another game, where he is hopefully more welcome than in ours."

Would they be safe to boil and use at that point? 2) Usually the things I've read say that the bark needs to be removed or it'll slowly peel off. As long as it were to not peel off in tiny pieces, and as long as it were safe, I wouldn't mind that. I don't have a sandblaster to remove bark with either. Is it out of the question to leave the bark on? (ie is it super obnoxious or toxic?) Thanks guys!"

I have not sold a book in a month which seems to coincide when the book was released ii) It seems they have also joined a UK based online forum pretending to me and have flooded the forum with lewd images and harassed forum members whilst impersonating me. I believe the forum administrators are also debating legal action against me? They have closed all forms of communication with me as they believe I am responsible for the attacks Should I contact the police?

Thus, it seems likely that the Vanduul are probably being chased into human territory by something even worse "" Well i have an idea. First point is each alian race has that tech that makes them different from humans. The xi'an have the better engine tech. The benu is still unknow ,the tevarin with their boarding ships and the vanduul are unknow also. But here is an idea. What about if the vanduul had the best jump drives. Makes sense as they are nomadic and tribal. So imagine when using their jump drive tech as u jump and look out at the jump tunnel u can see what look like truly demonic sceens. Shapes and monsters almost ripping into the jump tunnel with u. But never do. But in lore it could say that the vanduul pushed their jump drive tech too hard and ripped the jump tunnel open. Be it for a moment. And in come through truly horrific trans dimensional beings. Think of the movie Event horizon. And its this horror that the Vanduul are running from. It could be the new bad guy in 10 years when star citizen needs a reboot. What do u guys think?"

I do hoop dance so I brought my hoop with me and a bunch of old Asian men and women commented that they lived my Totoro rights, and the guys running that culture/info tent made me dance and share my dancing with them. It was great fun and I can't wait to go again next year. I posted about it on fb to a hooping group and got shit on about how I dont belong there and I was appropriating their culture and that the festival was made for people of color, not whites. So it's okay for Spanish and black people to go to learn, but not whites. Fuck that girl. I had a custard bun and faced to kpop. When I mention that I was excited that I heard music being played from Korea that I knew and loved (I love kpop, fight me), the girl on fb lost her shit. People like that drive me crazy. White people get so upset while the people actually a part of these cultures want nothing more than to share with us. :'("

The electorate gave that a chance, and decided it didn't work out for them. Centrist liberal elite parties are getting decimated all across the Western world. I think I most strongly just agree with your last sentence; I don't think Labour will seriously recover, even if we tossed Corbyn and found ourselves the idealized perfect leader who could please everyone in the party, unless the current neo-authoritarian political force just cocks up completely and gives liberalism leftism a chance to make its case again.

Some people do it on leg day instead but I'm personally not a fan of it. You can do shoulders on a separate day as well but then it's essentially a typical brosplit. You can then do shoulders + arms on that day instead of doing tri/bi on push/pull. But the main reason I'm running PPL is because I want to hit the same muscle groups twice a week and if you have an extra day for shoulders it will be one extra day between every Push/Pull/Legs if you know what I mean.

So I'm predicting next week we will see the Halloween update with a 3 week even run similar to the Summer Games. While many want an event currency, I'll predict we don't see it as Blizzard seemed, at least outwardly, satisfied with the even. By running three weeks it would be complete just a bit before Blizzcon. I'm predicting Sombra will be announced mid October with teasers and announced as playable at Blizzcon similar to Eichenwalde at Gamescom. I think we will hear about Overwatch's first new game mode and 2 maps associated with it to be released in December/January timeframe. That's my predictions for the next month or so.

The main thibng of jumper weapons is that they are made for jumping around and not dealing damage or to learn how to jump with certain weapons. Another problem is that this weapon has increased height and speed from jumps. Jumper weapons shouldn't have betetr movement than their normal counterparts. Learning with this weapon isn't possible because it doesnt provide the same movement as the normal weapon. But the biggest thing I have is that a Jumper Flare Gun would make the Detonator completely useless, because the entire use of the Detonator is the jumping. Making a weapon that focuses on jumping ruins this."

Now i'm wondering if the ps4 pro is worth it. Im mainly a pc player, so i would only play exclusives like uncharted and horizon. Also rocket league, and thats about it. I don't have a 4k tv and not planning on buying one soon (got a full hd tv, also a 1440p monitor but those aren't supported afaik) As i could get a normal ps4 pretty cheap now, is the pro version worth the 100-200 extra bucks? I'm kinda buying it just for TLOU, will the game benefit of the better hardware? I know everything with TLOU 2 is more of a speculation thing but i wanted to get some other opinions before buying :)"

1,Spoken like a true Tumblrina,"Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to eat 800 big Macs, but take it from this old McDonald's rat, I've spent my entire adult life eating at McDonnald's, and a program like this one can do more harm than good. If you only eat big Macs one part of your body (and that's all a single burger type like Big Mac is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times. Big Macs basically only train the gut muscles and to some extent, the esophagus. What you really want to do is train your entire digestive system, all the major gut groups (esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, and kidneys) at the same time, over the course of a Big Mac meal. So, you will need to add large Big fries, and Large coke with it. Ask for the ""Go Big"" program. I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three big meals! Falling in love with eating big Macs, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make. But do it right, okay? My advice, find any McDonnald near you, with qualified burger flippers who will design your burger for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for physical fatness. Three to 5 burgers a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is). And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being out of shape the first time you walk into McDonnalds. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway. Now get out there and get fat! :-)"
1,Haven't seen these exact criticisms before.,"Everything Dean Ambrose does inside the ring looks utterly fake. Sorry, i just can't get behind the guy.

First, it never looks real, makes absolutely no sense and takes a stupid amount of preparation to even make the move while the opponent stands there waiting for him to do it. By far the worst move in his arsenal. Every other moves just seems so... fake, like he's a bad physical actor, when i am watching guys like AJ, Seth, Jericho, i can believe that that is a real move within the WWE realm, but the ones done by Ambrose always, always look fake... Can't remember one wrestler who always seems fake. p.s. personal opinion, what do you guys think."

I advised them we could transport him to hospital for further tests but pt refused and his wife whom makes medical decisions stated that if pt didn't want to be transported he doesn't have to be. I suggested they make a follow up appointment and look into hospice care. We didn't do a 12 lead, which I should have to cover all my bases. I feel like I explained all the risks to the family but I honestly didn't expect him to code so soon. I knew it was inevitable because of his age and previous diagnosis but I didn't push for him to be transported. It makes me look and feel like shit that a guy I ran on the previous day coded within 24 hours. And not only do I feel like shit but I'm worried about the legal implications that could follow. Sorry for the novel, I just needed to get this off my chest. TL;DR: had a pt refuse transport now he ded"

His tackling and athleticism would make me a deadly weak side coverage backer.

And it doesn't mean there are no talented women (really?); just that by-and-large women and men tend to have slightly different talents and inclinations. What we need is equality of opportunity, and a willingness not to stereotype on the basis of aggregate behaviours, rather than equality of outcome. By far my best ever boss was a woman: calm, collected, fair, highly-competent, and treated everyone with respect. There are lots of good, intelligent women out there doing good work. And women are not the enemy. We'll just end up as warped and bitter as feminists if we go down that path."

Trouble is, my husband is not a US citizen and thus can neither donate to nor vote for Trump. I have no idea where they got his address, since he's not on any voter rolls. He does not subscribe to any magazines at our home address, which is a PO box. I opened the mail to see if I could rip it into tiny pieces and mail back in a prepaid envelope, but you had to put a stamp on to return it. So I heaved it in the recycle bin in the post office lobby, and noticed quite a few people had also received the same big envelope and trashed it unopened. The mailing had like a dozen separate pieces of crap inside, all printed, so that had to cost money to prepare, print, collate, etc. Direct mail solicitations like that have a notoriously poor return ratio, so it's nice to see Trump is wasting money on ineffective, old-fashioned, expensive direct mail efforts.

I already posted an intro video for it (Which should be somewhere in the hot posts I think?) and I have already finished the script for the first lore video. However, with the intro video I only used the intro cutscenes for Ocarina of time and Majora's Mask and I got copyrighted by Nintendo. Now I did not get a strike or anything for it but reading more into it; if I keep using gameplay of Zelda, I could actually get my youtube channel in trouble. It could technically never happen but it COULD. So my question is, what would you guys like to see in the video? I could try to fit images of something that's relating to what I'm saying in the video at the time instead of trying to put gameplay in there as that will result in more copyright trouble. Or I could put a non-zelda game gameplay in there BUT that wouldn't make sense to the lore but that's why I'm asking. What would you guys like to see? Should I keep on with gameplay and hope I don't get in trouble? Just try to find images and fit those in? Or put gameplay of something else on there? Let me know what you guys think! Once I get a good answer(s) I will start up on finishing my first lore video. I will post that here on the reddit so be on the lookout in a few days time! Cheers all"

Let me start by saying power creep will always be a thing in WF and I do not see that ever stopping. I do however believe that DE has taken some steps to slowing it. Passives are amazing! They change not only how you build weapons and what you decide to use but also how you play the game. A perfect example is the Telos Boltace which is quickly becoming a go to melee. Is it as powerful as the Galatine Prime? Debatable, but for killing a single tanky target no. But the way you play with the Telos Boltace changes everything. A somewhat good example of how weapon passives change the game is the Borderlands series. I would never want to see WF be as crazy as Borderlands, but some this are already starting to line up. For instance the Fomorian Accelerant mod for the Drakgoon adds a passive to make shots bounce off walls. This is similar to the Conferance Call shotgun in Borderlands 2. Furis's Winds of Purity mod turns it into a Moxie weapon. Why cant warframe have weapons that you can throw the clip out to explode doing damage equal to the bullets remaining? Or a sniper rifle the shoots a volley like Ivaras bow? Just add more cool passives and players will build around them."

A field test is not for your benefit, it is to help the cop arrest you. You do not refuse to take the test. You say you are incapable of doing the test. The cop will ask you several times, ""Are you refusing to take the test?"" Your answer is, ""No, I am not refusing, I am physically incapable of doing the test."" Then shut your mouth. There is no need to tell the cop why. The cop will then decide, based on how coherent you are when speaking with him, if you are let go, or taken to the station for a breathalyzer. I'm 50/50 on this so far. The first time I got to go the the station, where I blew a 0.000% BAC. The 2nd time I was let go. If I had done the field tests, I might have got a DUI."

My current company has health insurance at a good rate, but if I sign up for the family plan, it ends up taking about 25% of my paycheck which would be extremely unaffordable. This, combined with my wife's unpaid maternity leave, puts us in a very bad spot. What are our options for my wife to get affordable coverage? Any suggestions are welcome. We live in NY."

So I come from Lol and I decided to give HOTS a try when they removed the equivalent of Unranked Draft in my server as it was the only game mode I played. What surprised me the most was how different my tastes are in this game. In Lol, I mained mages (caster assassins like Jaina) and ADCs (auto-attack assassins like Raynor) because I liked dealing damage and carrying. However, in HOTS I feel rather indifferent towards that type of champion, but I'm completely in love with supports like Brightwing or Auriel who I simply can't stop playing. I'm not entirely sure why, but I guess it feels good to get some recognition in the MVP screen here, whereas in Lol supports are mostly invisible and noone ever notices them except for when they want to rage at someone when there isn't enough vision on the map. And it also feels like I have a noticeable impact in the game, whereas in lol it's mostly the equivalent of assassins that hog all the glory."

1,Acid rap was an amazing album im sure that had nothing to do with his rise to fame,"Local Chicago artists and rappers I've met believe his dad was instrumental in his rise. Chicago is fucking hard as shit to make it as an artist, partly due to lack of any major label representation. Especially when you're relying on live performances to get noticed. For such a large city, Chicago has a limited number of venues. The city plays a large part in this, mainly through noise restrictions. Even smaller number of venues where rappers can perform. Now because Chance's dad worked for the mayor's office in the past, people suspect he pulled strings that got him the shows he needed to play early on. I have zero evidence of this but after living in Chicago as a performing artist and witnessing first hand how crooked that city is I don't find it hard to believe."

0,What a bunch of miserable cunts!,"I can remember at my old job way back when, some of my female coworkers were shit testing me (before I knew what shit testing was) asking me why I'm not married, when will I get married etc. I told them that in the rare event that I did actually find a woman worth marrying, I would only marry her if she agreed to a prenup. Immediately my female coworkers began raising their voice saying ""What do you need a prenup for?!"" I mentioned that the divorce rate is 50% and 80% of those divorces are initiated by women, and we live in a state where the courts almost always side with women, and I've seen several of my friends get divorced, lose their house, lose custody of their kids, lose half of their possessions, and end up paying alimony to their ex-wives who are shacked up with someone else now. They all told me they wished they'd signed a prenup agreement before getting married. My female coworkers' reply was raising their voices even higher, and beginning a series of attacks against men directed at me: ""WELL IF MEN DIDN'T CHEAT SO MUCH, women wouldn't have to divorce them!"" ""IF MEN WEREN'T SO ABUSIVE all the time, women wouldn't leave them! ""If men spent more time with their WIVES, and less time with their friends women wouldn't have to sleep with other men!"" (You get the picture) This went on for the next 2 or 3 minutes until I finally walked away and went back to work. I was disturbed by the fact that they were up in arms and so upset by something hypothetical that had absolutely nothing to do with them, yet they felt it necessary to cram their bitterness for men down my throat. It only reinforced what I had started learning about TRP and made me reaffirm that I was taking the right steps towards MGTOW. Needless to say I was called into the office a few days later by my female boss, who said she was giving me a verbal warning because I had been saying sexist comments to some of my female coworkers. I told my boss that I had done no such thing, and I asked to know who thinks I've been making sexist comments towards them. She refused to tell me who and said that she had 3 witnesses that could verify what I had sad. I knew immediately then that it was the same coworkers asking me about marriage. She told me that sexist comments have no place here at work and that I was to treat all of my coworkers with respect, and if I didn't I would be giving a written warning, which could possibly lead up to termination. The next day I confronted my female coworkers and asked why they went to the boss saying I made sexists comments towards them. They said ""Because you DID!"" I said ""Bullshit! How is me not wanting to get married without a prenup sexist?"" They said that it's sexist if the man gets to keep everything and the woman gets nothing. I said ""The man doesn't keep everything, he just keeps what he came into the marriage with, and the woman gets to keep her stuff too! How is that sexist?"". They said ""If the man has more money, then it's not fair that the woman walks away with nothing and has to find a better job to support herself, and make house payments by herself, while the man gets to keep all the money."" I said ""If the man brought all the money into the marriage to begin with, then why should he have to lose any of it at ALL?"" They replied ""That marriage was about being equal, and women should get half of the stuff because they're half of the marriage, and they do things like cook, clean, raise the children etc."" I knew I was fighting a losing battle and wasn't going to change their minds, so I walked off again. Surprise, surprise I was called into the office the next day by my female boss, who said she was giving me a written warning for making a threat saying ""you better watch your back"" to my female coworkers. I told her again that I did no such thing, and that I take violence and threats very seriously. I told her I refused to sign the written warning, and if people continued to accuse me of things that I didn't do, I would be consulting with a lawyer. She said ""Fine I'll just write down here that you refused to sign the written warning, but you have been informed why you were written up, and if you are written up again in the next 6 months, you will be terminated."" You could imagine how furious I was, but I went back to my seat and didn't say another word. I could see my female coworkers out of the corner of my eye smirking at me and whispering to each other. It was at that point I began to realize why I was the only male worker there, they most certainly had run off any previous males that worked here. I went home and thought about it for a long time, and decided to put my 2-weeks notice in the very next day even though I didn't have another job lined up. Not the smartest move I know, but I thought it would be better to quit than to be fired over something I didn't do, and possibly face criminal charges from false accusations. The next several months were rough, but I'm so glad I left that job. TL;DR A long time ago some female coworkers shit-tested me about prenups, which I failed miserably, and it led to me losing my job. I also learned don't ever be the only male worker at a job, especially if your boss is female."

0,"Short answer; no If anything, official mod support is more prevalent than its ever been","Are PC Games Just Going to be Locked Down Now? One of the things I love most about PC gaming is the ability to mod and tweak games to get them as close as possible to the way YOU want them to be. Don't like the way the weapons sound? Find a sound mod for the game. Don't like the HUD? Mod it out! But more and more now I see games where it is impossible to to alter the game in any way, shape or form. They're kept completely locked down from the end user. Mafia III is the example I'm thinking of now, but it is far from the other one. I would love to change a lot of things about that game, from the ever present mini map to the weird cloud lighting ... but there is no way in. You will google in vain for any real ""Mafia III tweaks"" or ""Mafia III mods."" There's nothing out there. Just a wasteland of media PR for the game and that's it ... Is this the future of PC gaming? And why did it (d)evolve to become like this?"
1,hopefully you got the electric fence upgrade for the new one,"I wanted to get a new fence at my house, and I wanted to save money so I took down the old one myself a few days before the contractors came by to build the new one. Came home from work the next day to find a hobo passed out on the back porch. Called the police; they came by, got him to wake up, and moved him along. The officer implied that it was basically my fault for not having a fence. I didn't think that was a fair assessment of the situation, and I still disagree with her. Society functions because we have rules, and I feel that if one class of citizens is given a pass to break those rules (i.e. Hale's homeless policies or the recent verdict in the Malheur case), a dangerous precedent is established."

I feel like a decent two-way guard or small forward would help them greatly. - It's late and I can't find energy to look at salaries but *Kent Bazemore*, *Michael Kidd-Gilchrist*, *Solomon Hill* or *Brandon Rush* may be the help needed to make a deep run. I feel like each can contribute and fit on any team that can get the ball in the basket. ***Realistically***, I'd say Bazemore (even though his value went up after a 11/5/2 season) and Rush are more likely to be traded for, rather than Hill and MKG.

As you may know, one of Serqet's greatest initiations requires the relic ""Blink"". You find a target, blink to them and either 2 - 1 - 4 - auto or 4 - 2 - 1 - auto. During these combos I noticed I was missing opportunities quite a lot due to a delay after I blinked. I was wondering what was happening and it appears that Blink drops you at your teleport location, instead of teleporting you directly on the ground. It leaves you in a falling state momentarily after you blink into your location. Sort of like when you walk out of the fountain in assault. It also appears to carry your momentum even if you stopped pushing forward during the blink. I was wondering if its supposed to be like this or if its a bug that no one ever really complained about. Either way, it really bothers me sometimes and I would love if it was changed."

We need to take control of the clock and keep the Bills on the field. If we can do this, then we'll get a win. Pure and simple."

William = Wyatt is a longshot, and there's probably evidence disproving it (ignoring current unconfirmed theories) - but i dont think its purely coincidental he chose to dismember them all."
0,you on some IGN shit,"Pros: * Great voice. His natural voice has improved a lot, and you can tell that on Me and Your Mama and Stand Tall. * The instrumentals are interesting to listen to and super funky. Everything sounds pretty new to me as a rap fan. * The album is pretty short and easy to listen to imo. I don't consider anything filler and no stretch of the album seems weaker than any other stretch, so it's a consistent listen across the board. Cons: * This album doesn't really go anywhere, at least on the surface. After I finished it, I was just kind of like ""what was that?"" As I listen more and more, it gets a little better, but I wish it was more cohesive or at least had something stand out. * The vocoder can get a little irritating at times. Not too bad since I only notice this on California. Imo it's an 8.5/10. Not a lot to complain about. I'm on my fifth listen and it gets a little nicer each time. Pretty solid album. I do have to admit that I miss his rapping and more conventional songs. I appreciate the direction and I'm interested to see where he goes."

Adding more random events would be awesome. I've seen many posts about people's ideas for random events, but here's some of mine. Military Squad: A squad of military soldiers spawns at the top of the map, and will hunt players. Their weapons would include MP5s, LR300s, 92s and M249s, but also new military weapons such as AT4s, AWSMs, Desert Eagles and Tavor-21s. All of these weapons would drop. They would have exclusive military grade armour, which would be Helmet: Military Helmet, Top: BDU Top, Vest: Kevlar vest, Pants: BDU Pants, Gloves: Tactical Gloves (Also have a special ability to punch without any weapon) and Boots: BDU Boots M1 Abrams: A tank arrives at the coast (away from spawn) via a transport boat. It will only target players with a mid tier or better gun in their hot bar and at least 3 clothing items on. It would be extremely durable, and would have two firing modes, Cannon, which it aims its Cannon at a player and then fires a tank shell which does 200 Blunt and 300 Explosive Damage. Its other mode, Machine Gun, sprays bullets at players, dealing medium damage. Destroying the Tank makes the engine explode, and set fire for several minutes. It's crates would be similiar to the helicopter's crates. Ground Zero: At a random monument a nuclear siren will alarm. 45 seconds later, a nuclear missile will be visible and will hit the centre of the monument, turning every animal rad and increasing the radiation. The initial blast does 1000 explosive damage in a 30m squared radius. Shortly after, a squad of hazmat soldiers arrives and will kill anyone who is not in a hazmat suit.
