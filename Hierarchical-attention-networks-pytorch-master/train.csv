I really would like to appreciate all my peeps who make devoted as dank as it is. No other way to put it, really. I love how its a fairly relaxing civilization server instead of CivCraft. Less grind = more fun for everyone. Without factories on Civ - you couldn't do much at all. Here, you can thrive with or without them. No, I don't hate Civcraft because I do play fairly often and I've made quite the bunch of friends there. I've seen development yet it was very slow. But this ain't no complainin post about Civ. This is my post about appreciating devoted for what it is. So even though I just started devoted and I knew right from the start when 3.0 of devoted launched that the experience would be amazing and I wasn't dissapointed. This server is great. To the staff: keep up the hard work! If you agree with me, leave an upvote or reply with your thoughts on Devoted! Thanks for your time. Stay dank. -tnug out."

1,I could before,"I can't tell whether OP is just shitposting, but I'll jump in here to have a real conversation with y'all about this. The current design of the client would have to change pretty dramatically to make this change because there's nothing behind the friends list in the updated client. If you minimized it, we'd have to dynamically stretch everything to fill the space. Remember, we've redesigned just about every page in the updated client to work using the current layout. And it's designed to fit comfortably at the current aspect ratio with the friends list basically sitting to the side of it. To get super real with y'all, we've had a few people saying this whenever they get access to the alpha, but we think it's mostly just because it's a change from the legacy client, and we're expecting it to die down on its own. No one has really brought up an interesting reason for redesigning everything just so you could minimize it as before. It's only really been ""I could before.""

And it doesn't mean there are no talented women (really?); just that by-and-large women and men tend to have slightly different talents and inclinations. What we need is equality of opportunity, and a willingness not to stereotype on the basis of aggregate behaviours, rather than equality of outcome. By far my best ever boss was a woman: calm, collected, fair, highly-competent, and treated everyone with respect. There are lots of good, intelligent women out there doing good work. And women are not the enemy. We'll just end up as warped and bitter as feminists if we go down that path."

0,This is how I am going to explain it next time someone asks me why they need pilots.,"Mainly because of human unpredictability. You can program the best robot to fight literally anything but it follows a set of rules that can be exploited, learned and outplayed. A titans mind, while vast, is still finite. Take Ronin for example, the sword titan. Often, he states ""We are stronger together, pilot"" and it's true. With his processing speed, algorithms and logic combined with a humans intuition and risk/reward assessment (robots err on one side or the other, a human does not) they can make combined decisions leading to the best outcome. Also. A human can sacrifice themselves, a titan cannot sacrifice their pilot. Alone they are formidable, but together, they are only challenged by an equal."

0,If you can smell it is releasing stuff,"I've got some small fresh Manzanita branches. Is there any way I can quickly cure them for aquarium use? My understanding is that you don't want to put green branches into an aquarium. I've got a couple small tanks (5.5g, 2.5g) that I'd like to put these in, but only if I don't have to leave them outside for year(s) first. The branches are small, the biggest one has a maximum diameter of 0.75 inches, but they're mostly closer to 0.25-0.5 inches. The outer black bark is gone, but the inner red bark is still on them. Here's my questions: 1) Is there any way I can quickly dry them out in an oven or something? Would they be safe to boil and use at that point? 2) Usually the things I've read say that the bark needs to be removed or it'll slowly peel off. As long as it were to not peel off in tiny pieces, and as long as it were safe, I wouldn't mind that. I don't have a sandblaster to remove bark with either. Is it out of the question to leave the bark on? (ie is it super obnoxious or toxic?) Thanks guys!"

As frustrating as it is with conspiracy theorists (I mean I use that term even loosely because, as you mentioned, the extent of research these people do is a bunch of YouTube videos and Anonymous's Facebook feed nonsense) calling everyone who doesn't believe this trash ""sheeple"" and demanding that we ""wake up!"" and ""do research"" is equally as annoying as people who sit on the other side and attack them, saying that they're wearing ""tin foil hats"", that they are ""crazy"" and ""uninformed"". Honestly just let people form their own ideas even if they seem ridiculous. Their crazy ideas aren't hurting you. It seems that with social media everybody is quick to calling each other a *somethingist* and tell others how wrong they are. So what if they're wrong? and so what if someone doesn't believe what you do? It's exhausting, tiresome and pointless to try and convince a stranger on the internet to switch to your side, and it never happens. Basically I just hate both types of people with regards to this."

0,"I honestly wouldnt mind if DE decided to take a look at all weapons that were ""X weapon but worse in every way"" and give them some unique mechanic so that we dont just have like 20-30 useless weapons compared to the others.","Has DE Learned to Work Around Power Creep? Let me start by saying power creep will always be a thing in WF and I do not see that ever stopping. I do however believe that DE has taken some steps to slowing it. Passives are amazing! They change not only how you build weapons and what you decide to use but also how you play the game. A perfect example is the Telos Boltace which is quickly becoming a go to melee. Is it as powerful as the Galatine Prime? Debatable, but for killing a single tanky target no. But the way you play with the Telos Boltace changes everything. A somewhat good example of how weapon passives change the game is the Borderlands series. I would never want to see WF be as crazy as Borderlands, but some this are already starting to line up. For instance the Fomorian Accelerant mod for the Drakgoon adds a passive to make shots bounce off walls. This is similar to the Conferance Call shotgun in Borderlands 2. Furis's Winds of Purity mod turns it into a Moxie weapon. Why cant warframe have weapons that you can throw the clip out to explode doing damage equal to the bullets remaining? Or a sniper rifle the shoots a volley like Ivaras bow? Just add more cool passives and players will build around them."

I do hoop dance so I brought my hoop with me and a bunch of old Asian men and women commented that they lived my Totoro rights, and the guys running that culture/info tent made me dance and share my dancing with them. It was great fun and I can't wait to go again next year. I posted about it on fb to a hooping group and got shit on about how I dont belong there and I was appropriating their culture and that the festival was made for people of color, not whites. So it's okay for Spanish and black people to go to learn, but not whites. Fuck that girl. I had a custard bun and faced to kpop.

1,You've just caused the next school shooter you asshole,"Ignore me at the register? Enjoy an entire shift of awkward sexual tension. This happened like ten mins ago. I'm still basking in the glory of it, actually. I decided to eat at this hot dog place near work for lunch, and when I approached the register I noticed two employees chatting at the end of the counter. They're both teenagers, one awkward dude and a pretty, attractive girl. I stand there waiting and the guy looks over, sees me, and then turns to continue talking to the girl. I am not really the kind of person to say ""excuse me!"" so I just stood there. I was waiting long enough to get my phone out and text my friend about the situation. So dude's really working it, trying to be funny. All the while she's occupying herself with some task and laughing politely. Dude is laughing hard at his own jokes and straight up ignoring me. Finally the girl sees me and nods in my direction, telling dude to go do his job. When he walks up, I am really pissed off. I'm not really in the business of confronting strangers, but this one bothered me more than usual. So I say loudly, ""hey, glad you could take a break from trying to bang your coworker to take my order."" At this, dude looks quickly to the girl and she visibly recoils and says, ""ugh, what?"" Dude tries to recover, saying he didn't notice me standing there, but the damage had been done. He looked defeated, girl looked extremely uncomfortable, and now I'm eating in the corner watching them actively ignore each other and pretend the other doesn't exist. Enjoy the rest of your shift, awkward teenage boy. Also, sorry about the collateral damage, teenage girl."

The game really made me realize how much people will want to take advantage of you and use you any chance they get, but that by believing in yourself and in those you trust you can reject what is thought of as ""normal"" or ""right"" and do what you believe in. Even though some may think that what you do is abnormal or unusual, what matters the most is that you have confidence in yourself and in what you are doing.

1,"You said ""I'm know there's more"" maybe you should've drafted your post on paper and had a coworker proof read it .","I babysat Kevin at work One of my ex-colleagues is Kevin. At the time, I was around 25 and he was almost 30. It was his first 'real job' out of college. He apparently grew up in a very sheltered, religious household. His dad is apparently a very high-ranking official in the UN. And due to an unfortunate strings of circumstances, Kevin sat next to me: * Kevin had zero computer skills. As a new employee, the company will issue you the standard computer, 8GB flash drive, along with employee handbook, etc. etc. He refused the flash drive because the size was too small (physically) and he believed it won't have any storage capacity. * So he kept having to borrow my flash drive. He also didn't know how to plug it into his computer and kept complaining that the flash drive is ""broken"". * We're an international company with offices in many countries. So, it goes without saying that we all communicate through email. He drafts EVERY EMAIL (even simple replies) on PAPER and then asks me to proof read it before he sends it out. He works as a COPYWRITER. * He asked me if the ""SEND"" button in Outlook means that his email was sent out. * He has more than once got scammed by those Nigerian Prince emails. He sends them his password when they ask for it. * He likes to google my full name (it's not a common name at all. Only I have it.). He googles it often enough that it pops up every time he types in the first letter of my name on Google. One day, he got so excited and showed it to me because I was ""FAMOUS"" because Google knows my name. * Each month, the housekeeper would walk around and issue out tissue paper to put at our workstation. The first time, he asked me what it was. * He drives the cleaning ladies insane by going into the pantry, use plates and mugs and put them back in the cupboard without washing them. When confronted, his argument was that he'll use it again eventually. * He likes to listen in on conversations. More than once, he would ask me what people in five workstations away were talking about. * He stares at people. ALL. THE. TIME. And stare at your computer screen and comment on what you're working on. * He didn't know how to put staples in staplers. When I helped him with it, his reply: ""Thank you so much. I'm just not used to these new technologies."" * He constantly asks people how much their salary is. * His probation period was extended (understandably. he was still asking me to proofread his emails). When HR told him, he threw a tantrum claiming that they can't do that because he already told his mom that he passed the probation. * He often takes his copywriting work home for his mom to check. This is what I can think of from the top of my head. I'm know there's more as he drove me nuts to the point that I wanted to quit and the Head of HR had to console me. I was his designated babysitter for the duration of his time there. People still joke that one day he might come into the office and shoot everyone. I would be the first to go."

I've often created fun and interesting decks for non-competitive play. I like to try strange decks just to see if I can get them to work. I think it's fun and it's one of the ways I have found to alleviate frustration when grinding ladder. A problem, though, is that I'll make a funky pirate shaman deck or a rogue deck with only two minions, etc. and want to just dick around and have fun with it. I'll go into casual and lose to aggro shaman or control Mage enough times that I feel like I should be playing a ranked deck to have a little more fun, and I'm back to grinding ladder. This brings me to my point. You can choose the class you play against in practice mode, letting you see how your deck fares in certain match ups. I think it would be fun and innovating to be able to choose a deck for the innkeeper to play against you. This could have practical benefits (like a mirror match to test out changes in a ranked deck) or it could be really fun (giving the innkeeper a golden Milhouse Manastorm). It could even be used to mess with deck interplay (thief rogue against a stacked deck). What do you guys think?"

Seems like the right move to me if that's accurate. I just never agree with punishing the user. Jail and/or fines is not how you help an addict, if anything you just throw their life into an even worse position."

Some of the stuff, from all three of those, isn't simply progressive, but extreme leftist material. Given that this is a public school, it really doesn't feel right."

He said it was horrible. You're in a buzzy place and your head hurts, he said it was like a ten minute k hole. He said the headache lasted a day or two. So what are those chemicals? Well they vary from blend, but they are synthetic cannabinoid. You remember how people say weed is natural? This is fake lab made shit. Is it safe? It says right on the packet ""not for human consumption."" You be the judge."

0,Keep the dog dump the dude is the only answer dog owners ever need.,"SNW and the engagement BIL Hey gang! I found time to write a bit so here it goes! Remember BIL is dating now SIL and he's now thinking of marrying her. We were sitting in the room at the il's house just us three. BIL is talking to DH about it. SIL has a dog that she's had for years. It was a gift to her by her father when he became very ill, near death. The reality hit him that life is short and he decided to start making good on some of his promises before he died. He always told SIL he would get her a dog, they were a military family, and he'd always say the next place we move I'll get it for you. So he got her this dog at that time and she loves her dog and he has sentimental value to her. Now, BIL has not yet met this dog because you know it's serious when you meet the dog. BIL sates to DH: Well the dog has to go. I have allergies and I can't be living with a dog. I know the dog has sentimental meaning for her because of her dad but my health is more important than a dog. She's waiting for me to meet the dog because she wants him to slowly warm up to me. This is stupid, it's just a dog... I don't see what the big deal is. I want to marry her but if we get married we'll already have to get an apartment and that costs money there (both of them at the time were living with their parents and would meet each other for dates and such). If we keep the dog then we have to pay extra money for pet rent and I'm not paying extra money for a dog!!! DH is just nodding his head and listening (he's pretty laid back and quiet always like this guess it's true opposites attract). I'm thinking how rude is this guy? He wants to marry her and is supposed to love her but can't have compassion for what she loves??? I know he's SNOT JR. For sure. Anyway he meets the dog and they get engaged. They have all these big events that I find my way out of because I can't stand being around them. They had a family celebration right after he proposed and a joint couple shower. SNW knows how creative and crafty I am, especially after my wonderful diy wedding decor, so she asks me to help her decorate for the rehearsal dinner. I reluctantly agree to help her. DH and I have been married over 3 years at this point. SNW has never made any efforts to call, text, smoke signal, or communicate with me in any way or form any relationship with me. Can't remember if I posted about this before but I did invite her to an event to be the bigger person, but she basically fought me even giving it to her. The event was based on a book and I wanted to buy her the book and put the tickets inside as a Christmas gift. She was like oh I don't want a book. And then proceeded to text DH about how she doesn't want whatever I'm trying to get her, that he knows the type of gifts she likes and to stick to that. I was so angry... I was raised knowing when people get you a gift you accept because the person thought about you and took their time to get it for you so be grateful! Guess not everyone learned that. I still invite her after my moms advise but said well I was trying to do this for you but since you didn't want it I'm asking you now would you like to go with me. Then she's like oh I would love to go I had no idea thats what it was, super nice in front of everyone. We went to the event and she straight up did not talk to me the whole time and went off in her own during the intermissions. Sorry for going off topic but you get the point. Now all of a sudden she's blowing me up about this wedding rehearsal. She texts several times a day and calls about her ideas and sends me pics. She's always like Hi how are you then goes for what she wants... I'm not fooled at all, she never cared how I was doing for over three years. She says Oh well SIL and I have been talking about the plans and blah blah blah. Basically trying to run in my face that she talks to SIL all the time and she's being involved in the planning. unlike with my wedding, but that's because she got mad at me for not doing what she wanted and did CBF the rest of the time I was planning. I tell DH about this sudden change of behavior and how much involved SNW is in this wedding as compared to ours. He suggests well maybe because she has a good relationship with SIL she realizes she needs to do better with you and this is her way of reaching out to you... I say maybe but I know its all fake..."

I was really excited because I remembered the community around the launch of Early Access to be nice, communicative, and overall helpful. The game felt fun. I used to play a lot of MOBAs, and this was a breath of fresh air. In the four games today (Christmas, of all days) I've had three teammates tell me that I'm ""absolute shit"" and to go ""kill myself"". What happened to this community? It feels like a MOBA community (not quite as bad as LoL, but it's starting to have a familiar feel to me) more than it used to feel just like a bunch of people trying to compete yet still enjoying the competition, even if someone is having a bad game. It makes me hesitant to keep at it, and I was excited about getting back into it. :'("

After the third time I saw him do it, I told him not to do that shit ever again and to just turn the fan on over the stove and shut the kitchen door. He pissed an moaned like crazy. About 2 months later he had a candle burning in his room with the window open. The wind blew a sombrero off the wall and onto the candle. It caught some clothing and part of the bed and the room started to go. It triggered the smoke alarm and I was able to get to it with an extinguisher before the room was fully involved. If that had happened and we didn't have batteries in that smoke alarm, the entire building would have been a loss. The best part? He was pissed at me for getting ""fire extinguisher dust"" all over his room. Ironically, he was kicked out because he caused flood damage a few months later."

Since Clash Royale has become pretty competitive in it's life time, I think it would be a great idea to add something like casual mode. Right now you can only play ladder, tournies and challenges. Two of which need gems to be played (or you join a free tourny, but it's incredibly difficult to find one these days). Ladder is great and all, but you get frustrated really quick, so I don't see a reason why a casual mode shouldn't be added."

I was working in a sunglass and lifestyle store when I got bored and decided to cover myself from head to toe in snowboarding gear. All the way from pants and jacket to gloves, facemask, goggles and hat. Not a single piece of skin was showing. I goofed off in the store for a bit and then decided to go stand in the big glass front window. This is where the FU happens. I am standing in there as still as can be and getting a couple of weird looks but nothing too strange. For the most part people aren't noticing me. Then a little kid (maybe 12 years old) comes right up to the glass and stares at me, obviously noticing something isn't right. That's when the practical joker in me takes over and I throw my hands up and scare the crap out of the little bugger. He runs off half scared half laughing and I leave the window display and get back to actually working. A few minutes later an older fellow comes in and says he saw what I did and that it was incredibly racist...ohh, I didn't mention that the little kid was black, because to a normal person they wouldn't even think in those terms. The older fellow was black too. He goes on to tell me that he's a professor at one of the Ivy League colleges across town and that he studies this kind of stuff regularly and that what I did was incredibly racist. He lectured me a bit more, and I just stood there and listened since I was so caught off guard then he finished by saying that it was because of people like me doing that kind of stuff that black people were afraid of white people. TLDR: pretended to be a mannequin. Scared a little kid who happened to be black. Got called a racist."

0,Customers never respect stores closing It is always about what they want Most have no clue how that second can totally throw off a closing shift and they really don't care :/,"Sir, we're closed... Tonight, at 10pm, my store closed. I cashed out my last customer. As I handed her the receipt, another guy walks in, past the automatic doors that were put on halfway open to accommodate my last customer. My shift lead is standing by the doors, keys in hand. ""Sir,"" my shift lead calls after him, ""it's 10 o clock, we are closed."" ""Oh, I know, I'll only be a sec!"" Guy keeps walking back towards the pet stuff. My shift lead lets my last customer out, and stands by the doors, and I can see she's fuming. Here comes Special Guy. ""See! I was only a second! Haha!"" Special Guy literally puffs out his chest with pride. I ring up his 15 big cans of dog food, and bag them in his gross smelling bag. I tell him his total, he pays, and he's watching both of us, and we are less than thrilled with him. ""Geez, ladies, lighten up! I was only a second!"" My shift lead shakes her head. ""Yes, but you're cutting into our closing ops, and yes, 5 minutes DOES make a difference."" She unlocks the doors to let him out, bidding him adieu. And his parting words to us? ""I was only a second though! Good night!"" Good lord, dude. We are open 14 hours; you had all damn day! Also, before my head gets bitten off, I'm aware some people work doubles or long shifts; I am one of them (my other job). But there is a grocery store open until midnight, and the mini mart open until 11pm that can see you through. Sorry, just...argh!!!!!"

1,hopefully you got the electric fence upgrade for the new one,"I wanted to get a new fence at my house, and I wanted to save money so I took down the old one myself a few days before the contractors came by to build the new one. Came home from work the next day to find a hobo passed out on the back porch. Called the police; they came by, got him to wake up, and moved him along. The officer implied that it was basically my fault for not having a fence. I didn't think that was a fair assessment of the situation, and I still disagree with her. Society functions because we have rules, and I feel that if one class of citizens is given a pass to break those rules (i.e. Hale's homeless policies or the recent verdict in the Malheur case), a dangerous precedent is established."

1,that's not a very nice thing to say about Susan Sarandon,"""If you vote for Hillary you're an adult. If you vote for Trump you're a sucker. If you don't vote at all you're an asshole.""

0,congratulations now everyone sees your motorcycle as a motorcycle for midlifing losers,"I dunno, doesnt make any sense to me really. If an advertizer wanted to relate/connect motorcycling with the image of ""freedom"" I wouldn't pick a dude standing on the seat of a sportbike... I'd say something more like a quick 7-8 second montage of a man at a cubicle getting yelled at in slow motion by his boss, stacks of papers all around him, cut to slow motion of him at home and his wife in an apron holding a newborn baby shaking her head in disaproval at him (slo-mo again of course) Cut to him standing in a downtown city at dusk in the rain hanging his head looking depressed, and as he looks over at a window, there's a motorcycle in the shop and it's a new bike- he's next to a dealership and the rain stops- last shot is a close up of him riding that new bike and smiling. Freedom. Or something like that.. But I guess thats just a motorcycle ad... Not sure how to attach a phone to it."

1,Better bring in poor unskilled minorities from overseas instead.,Skilled immigrants that you don't need to train or assimilate into the workplace. Doesn't get any better than that.

1,"SD821 0 dropped frames, Pixel or nothing","My opinions on minimum device performance So, for me the thresholds for the lowest specs you need nowadays go like this. If you want a fast experience, comparable to a modern flagship, is a Snapdragon 800 and stock Android. Nexus 5 fits this perfectly. For the minimum usable, I'd say Snapdragon S4 Pro, aka the Nexus 7 2013. This is noticeably slower with some lag, but not enough to really slow you down. Loading up more intense websites can be a pain. Feels like a budget device. So, what are your thoughts on this?"

1,The cannon is just trying to save you ammo bro,"That system of fire is pretty annoying What is the problem? Well, let me explain. For example, you have a cannon in center, and your opponent puts MiniPekka. Pewpewpew, and one-shot MP comes to cannon. It should fire to save its live, BUT! Archer tower already sent an arrow, and cannon thinks ""Mmm, MP is going to die from this arrow, (and i am so lazy), i wouldn't shoot"". Arrow velocity is pretty slow, and when it comes to target, MP already cut down that cannon. And during the arrow's flight there was enough time for cannon to shoot and kill that damn MP. But it refuse. Does it annoy only me or there are somebody else?"
