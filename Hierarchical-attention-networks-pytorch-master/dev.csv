Bluffing in poker isn't an ""I'm Feeling Lucky"" choice. Chasing a flush to the river is an ""I'm feeling lucky"" choice. Bluffing properly is making bets representing cards you don't actually have to make other people think they may not have the best hand on the table. Bluffing cards you don't have is the same part of the same strategy as slow playing a hand when you know for a fact you have the best hand on the table and want other people to think they've got the best hand. Bluffing happens with good cards as well as bad cards. That is literally the game of poker."

0,Thank you for taking the time to write this.,"I get that you're trying to annoy people by parroting their language but you should know that using the term triggered to denote mild emotional upset is actually really offensive to people who have experienced significant trauma. It also trivialises what is actually important terminology in trauma treatment. A trigger being something that is likely to cause a re-experiencing of trauma (e.g., a gun shot for someone who developed PTSD at war). While it's really fun to bash pc culture (apparently), the aim of ""trigger warnings"" is to give approprtie warning to PTSD sufferers that a topic being covered may cause them to reexperience their trauma in a situation that could be very difficult to dealt with (e.g., Discussing rape in a lecture theatre for someone who was traumatised by rape). Talking about being ""triggered"" by something that is merely annoying is actually quite cruelly mocking."

0,It's just a bullshit done by conservative to downplay any culture that is against Conservative's view(aka Islam).,"""Budaya Ketimuran"" I bet most peoples here are already familiar with this term. And i have to admit, back then i actually buy and believe this idea that Eastern culture is promoting all sort of ""good"" morality value (ex: polite clothing, family value, religion, etc). But as time goes, i realize how questionable it really is. Eastern culture are very different from one another. There is the more ""conservative"" Middle Eastern culture, the more ""liberal"" country such as Japan and South Korea, the strict government controlled country such as China and of course there is ""Best"" Korea. Basically, it's a very wide spectrum and contain a lot of value that contradict one another. Perhaps the only value that i can agree to be still totally applied to all or at least most of them is the family value. In my opinion, the current Indonesia tries too hard to be on the conservative spectrum of the Eastern culture, while some of it's citizen openly (or secretly) want to be on the more liberal spectrum of lifestyle/culture. I know it might be a bit of an over-simplification, but what do you guys think?"

0,But you can't buy it separately from the new Space COD.,"COD4 Remastered Could Force Valve to be more Responsible with CS **If we were to push for promod**, which could gain some interest from the large fanbase of teens/preteens (and let's face it, that is an important part, though not only one, to a competitive community), we could actually give CS a good competitor, and run for its money, thereby improving CS as a result. We are seeing it happen with Overwatch and TF2, with less of a disparity of popularity between CS and COD. As a result, unlike the former example, CS and COD would together create healthy and good competition. However, it would only be achievable if CS players wanted to petition COD4 to make the game capable of hosting mods, etc., in order to foster a significant competitive community around promod. They will have skins and gun-inspecting, so I bet that it will already be a great opportunity to create a similar system like CSGL. What they need is push from pro communities, including those from in CS, that would ultimately nudge Valve off their asses."

He now told me he saw my rap text I've written (I only did this for fun with my friends). It was saved on my desktop as a textfile. I wasn't sure how to react to it, I was shocked and it was pretty awkward for me. I seriously want to cry and just forget about it... oh well.

They are: ""No One Like You"" - Scorpions; ""The Wolf"" - Mumford &amp; Sons; ""Arabella"" - Arctic Monkeys. The difference this week is that today's DLC release is not related to the challenge.

There are 1997 crews at Silver level and 5008 at Bronze. These are the PS4 stats from last night. If anybody wants to post the XB1 stats, please do so. As an interesting stat, I noticed at least 2 crews posting a staggering 1 million+ XPs last week.

0,OP needs to go make some new friends at his new home.,"What the fuck is going on with me right now Suddenly I feel a really strong nostalgia. I saw some pics of my friends (the ones before I moved to another country) and that almost gave me an anxiety attack. I have my life under control now more than I have ever had it. I am free, living by my own means, in an awesome city that is Ne-heaven, with my whole life in front of me and a world of possibilities, but what I miss is my previous life. I mean, I have no friends yet compared to the wide social circle I had there, my girlfriend is 8 hours away, compared to the 20 minutes it was before, and my parents are 2000km away; but that happens and one has to accept it. I am free to do with my life what I want now, but what I want is my old life, which can't be done. And the worst thing is that I know that I will be fine, and that I will have a lot of awesome moments with a lot of new people, but with every second I will be further away from those days. I feel like crying right now. Until now I had always assumed that at some point I would reunite back with people that left my life. However, I saw a picture of who was my best friend years ago (who moved to his home country) and realised that he is a different person now, and I am too, and there is a probability that we will never see each other in person again for the rest of our lives. Then I realised that my friends group will never be the same again. Or that my relationship will probably end at some point since we are just 18/19. Or that my old room in my parents' house will never feel like my room again. I don't know why I assumed that at any given time I would be able to say ""fuck it"" and go back. It was just an illusion. Things will never be the same again even if I try to make them the same. I guess everyone older than me has gone through this at some point. How did you guys overcome this feeling?"

So would the Mcree skin be as cool if every single game everyone has it? I don't think so.

0,"Welp, this is a first.","My game last night... We were playing a team that we don't like. Lots of showboats and guys that shouldn't be playing in our level. For some reason there was a decent crowd there too. Most weeks it's just a few of our wives and some other passerby's. Anyway, after a hard fought two and half periods we were down 4-2 with about 9 minutes left. After a few good chances by my forwards we got an offensive zone face off. I set up a few feet in front of the blue line (playing left defense) and waited for my center to win the draw back to me. Just like that he does, and the puck is on my stick. I look up, see my lane, and fucking blast it. Top shelf glove side. Goalie didn't even see it. Woo! We are within one now. A few minutes later we have another great rush into the zone and my winger dishes it back to me. I snap it right through the wickets. Kessel style. It was beautiful. My team was ecstatic. My first multi goal game and at a perfect moment. Got an audible cheer from the crowd too. Felt fantastic. Feeling on the top of the world I am trying everything I can to clear our zone. Our goalie made some incredible saves, and with about 45 seconds left I block a slapper from the point and the puck somehow ends up in a perfect position for me to go with it. I skate as fast as I ever I have, the game on my stick. Caught their D flat footed and only have one guy on me back checking hard. I manage to get some space and go to wrist it hard when.... BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP FUCK! It was all just a dream. Father Time robbed me of my hat trick! I will never know. Such a great, yet disappointing way to start my day. Sorry for the long read. Just thought I'd share my hockey dream with you guys. It was extremely realistic, and I very rarely remember my dreams with so much detail. Maybe it's an omen?!

1,Give Brother Trump a break!,"Apologists for Trump Some audio recordings have surfaced recently that allegedly show Mr. Trump engaging in lewd and disrespectful conversations towards women. These tapes have been released by Anti-Trump activists in an effort to discredit his candidacy and leadership. These critics have gone as far as to demand that Trump resign his candidacy. As is expected, these critics have failed to evaluate all the available information, and have chosen a very narrow interpretation of the facts we have available to us, opting instead for media-friendly soundbytes that demonize Mr. Trump. The basis for these claims is a single low-quality recording of Mr. Trump engaging in a conversation with another man. A layperson listening to this tape will conclude that the speaker is Donald Trump, but voice analysis and identification is a complex field, and it's easy to jump onto the media bandwagon without proper analysis. Voice identification is more ""art"" than science, and many states don't even allow voice identification to be entered into evidence. Even with leading voice identification techniques, we can only be 99.9% sure that the voice on the recording is Donald Trump's voice. While this is touted by critics as a smoking gun, what they fail to mention is that even with these odds, there are tens of thousands of *other* people whose voice matches the recording. How can we be certain that the voice we've heard is in fact Mr. Trump's? There are over 100 million citizens that have pledged their support for Mr. Trump. If Mr. Trump was really a horrible mysogynist as he's painted to be, how could so many people be misled? And with so many Trump supporters, couldn't we reasonably expect that there would be more than just a single low-quality recording as evidence for his behavior? With all the people he comes in contact with, you would expect more evidence against him. When it comes to Anti-Trump supporters, you will find that they make wild claims against him, but almost always fall short when it comes to producing evidence. Even with taking the recording at face value, it requires a number of significant logical leaps to conclude that Donald Trump was saying the types of things he's being accused of. Most of the recording is actually very benign in nature, and even sentimental as he talks about taking his wife furniture shopping. For example, Donald talks about taking a woman named ""Nancy"" to go furniture shopping. It's automatically assumed that he's referring to someone besides his wife, Melania. However, in American slang, men often refer to beautiful women as ""nancy"", so it would be natural for a man to refer to his wife as nancy. Plus, wouldn't you naturally go furniture shopping with someone you share a home with? It's a big stretch to assume that Donald would engage in an illicit affair by participating in such a domestic activity. Donald's critics have really outdone themselves on this one. What's next? Donald is trying to convince a woman to have sex by purchasing her some cleaning supplies at Walmart? Next, Donald is accused of embracing rape culture by using his social status to kiss and grope women. This claim is so ridiculous on its own that is hardly merits a rebuttal, but we live in a world where even the most ludicrous of claims can spread if they are unchallenged. If Donald Trump really behaved in this way, we would expect to see hundreds of videos of Mr. Trump forcing himself onto women, attempting to kiss them or to grab their genitals. To date, we don't have a single video of this type of behavior, or even a reliable report of such behavior. The lack of evidence speaks volumes. The most inflammatory part of the recording was Donald's use of the term ""pussy"". As we're aware, one of the meanings of this word in American slang is very vulgar and refers to women's genitalia. However, critics fail to explore other common meanings that actually make more sense. The second most well-known meaning is short for ""pussycat"", a common name for a cat. At the time of the alleged recordings, a very famous singing group named The Pussycat Dolls enjoyed widespread success. During this time period, the use of the word ""pussy"" increased dramatically. It's easy for us recoil at hearing this word today, and failing to realize that this was a very common word used in 2005. Also, ""grab the cat by the tail"" is probably one of the oldest and most widely used expressions in the English language. Further, cats have a reputation for short attention span, so the phrase ""grab them by the pussy"" would be a short way of Mr. Trump saying that he was always trying to grab and keep the attention of females during their courtships. It's amazing how these types of accusations can be ... oh... wait... really?? ok... Donald Trump has just confirmed that it was his voice on the tapes, and issued an apology for the language he used. It's not uncommon for us to want our leaders to be perfect, but reading through history and the scriptures, we learn that even the most powerful leader has momentary lapses in judgement. For example, Lot had sex with his daughters, and Noah got drunk and laid out without any clothes on. However, when we understand that our leaders are human, it can add richness and depth to their character, and help us to appreciate them on a deeper, more nuanced level. The message is true, and it's imperative that you donate to the campaign and push this election forward."

Open sourcing not just the code but the raw or semi-processed data may yield unexpected benefits to Kiva, e.g. in overall visibility and lender community growth. Of course, if the official numbers are padded and the underlying data doesn't support them (e.g. expirations), then this might not be the case. Even though Kiva is a 10+ year old fintech, non-profit SF startup, I still see Kiva as somewhat of a black box. I trust Kiva to a certain degree, but even if the cause is good, for many people I suspect simply knowing where to place $ and the trust levels of those potential places may turn a lot of people off from Kiva. The Kiva US program may be the answer right now to grow the program, but I would also suggest considering more the potential for further organic growth stemming from the existing community."

Now, I understand how easy it is to build such an enclosure, and we're certainly capable of doing it. But, in case we're for some reason not allowed to do that, I need a backup printer.

Also, why does living in a densely populated area make one's individual vote less important or just as a method for choosing one's governance!? How is it more fair that fewer people, living in rural areas, get to decide for the urban and suburban majority? Is land more valuable as a voting metric than actual human beings? The arguments for the electoral college are insane, and seem to be nothing more than confirmation bias. Because we were raised to idolize the founders and venerate the Constitution, we turn increasingly bizarre mental gymnastics to support the short-sighted and arcane compromises that make up large sections of the Constitution. The electoral college is an anachronism, and a failure, and is resulting in something worse than the tyranny of the majority: the tyranny of the minority. Moreover, the arguments that the EC would prevent the rise of a demagogue are now being proved conclusively and wholly incorrect, as the most textbook of demagogues has been elected by a minority."

0,I want to tweet this thread at everyone who works on the Android team at Google.,"Have the battery problems officially been Acknowledged by Google? So, just like a 'few' others here I'm still pissed at Google. There were 5 developer previews and most people didn't have any problems with them - besides stability and app compatibility - and when the final release hits, we got battery drain that cripples the phone heavily. I don't wanna use Battery Historian, X root apps, use a custom kernel or disable the backup functionality of my Android phone just so that I get 'about the same' battery life that I had when I used 6.0. I effing 'need' my phone for work, I can't plug it in every 3 hours when I have to use it heavily/have shitty reception. So, my question is, have the battery problems been acknowledged anywhere? The Android bugtracker? I remember that Hiroshi Lockheimer told someone on Twitter to DM him about his problems but a bunch of users mentioned him and nobody knows if he really got any logs or descriptions about the problems. Do we really have to wait until 7.1 hits when the new Pixel devices hit the market? (If we can be lucky enough to get it directly after launch without Google doing some kind of exclusivity for 7.1 for the Pixels). Even if it hits, we don't have any confirmation about them addressing the bug, who knows if it's even gonna get fixed in 7.1? Really, if Google wants to make the iPhone competitor they may make with the Pixel devices, they have to step up their game. Apple would be arrogant but acknowledge those bugs somehow but Google is silent about them AFAIK. (Sorry, I just had to rant somewhere and I connected that rant with a question, so feel free to answer the question and react/rant with me.)"

The problem with battleship HE is that the damage is weak. It's weak because battleship dispersion is huge and you end up missing a lot of your shells, unlike a cruiser and thus you end up not doing much damage. When you use AP you have the same problems, but if your enemy makes a mistake AP can capitalize heavily on it. The cool thing with firing HE, though, is that the more people on your team are firing HE the better, since HE synergizes with itself due to fires."

I have nothing to say that hasn't been said already, the game's awesome and deserves all the praise it gets. However, the game still hasn't grabbed me yet; I've ""only"" played 40 hours in four months, but I think that's mostly because I'm tired of open games in general, not due to the game itself.

0,"The only coherent thought I read, one I am pretty sure you didn't mean to make, is that why should it be okay to regulate speech that instigates violence (terrorism), but not speech that instigates ignorance that can cause serious harm and death to children?","So nobody cares about the obvious violation of freedom of speech? As far as im concerned posting on your own social media page is EXACTLY the same speaking to a group of your peers. Do we really want to live in a society where an administration can tell you what you can and cant talk about outside of the workplace? Simply because the latest scientific data happens not to support a conclusion, does not give any 1 or 1 million humans the authority to impose their will on another. If you disagree, then by that same logic should we not be prosecuting every religious leader and politician that promotes ideologies that spread violence, hate, and fearmongering unless it's backed by the latest science? Keeping in mind that the manipulation of the masses through systems of government and religion has resulted in countless wars raged over the history of humanity as well as the enslavement of entire populaces. Do you really want to compare the deaths or horrors of non vaccination vs war and slavery? Where's the prosecutions now? Preserving the inalienable rights of the people is more important than ""saving lives"", because once we relinquish those we lose our freedom."

I wanted to ask if any of you have felt the same way about a show before. TL;DR: I love animation. I am not enjoying SDF Macross as much because of the constant drops in animation.

0,Right here.,"the only way anything you are saying makes anysense is if you don't realize that Hillary really isn't any better than Trump. If you think for a minute that many of us legitimately cannot vote for Hillary because she is responsible for the deaths of close to a million people then you might realize that you picked an unelectable candidate and lectured us about why she was better. It doesn't matter that a majority of democrats were tricked into voting for her through the DNC's collusion with the media: she was a terrible candidate and we all knew it. You can keep sticking your head in the sand all you want but it doesn't change the fact that we do have an electoral college and you can't win with just California and NY. She was always going to lose to who ever the republican was. Pence would have beat her, so would Jeb, or any of the other Republican candidates. You and everyone that voted for Hillary need to wake the fuck up, stop watching nbc, cbs, cnn, fox, msnbc and realize that they sold you Hillary for the last 3 years and you never got your head out of the box and went along with it hook, line, and sinker."

In 4 or 8 years, the Libertarian candidate will have a much greater, and more realistic shot at winning after Trump. The Libertarian candidate will have no chance of winning after Hillary."

Every week, a family member brings home a pack of ""K-cups"" from her job, and we brew those consistently throughout the week. Once I learned that this product is harmful for the environment, I purchased a reusable plastic cup and bought bags of coffee grounds so as to not be wasteful. A problem lies in the fact that other members of my family prefer using the plastic pods, and it would be difficult to convince them to stop. I don't think my individual problem is very important, but a microcosm of the problem facing society as a whole. Waste is mostly a matter of convenience. If the average person finds an empty soda bottle in the street, they won't exhaust themselves looking for a recycling bin, but throw it in the trash. The American attitude towards recycling is very ambivalent, and environmental concerns are often seen as luxurious by people faced with more immediate personal problems. With that said, what can people do? I know the whole ""If everybody did it..."" mentality is true, but it seems trivial when tech giants like Amazon and Google speed into new levels of waste and nothing can be done about it. How do you reconcile your own efforts in the face of this?"

0,In your situation I'd cut him out of my life but make it very clear that it's because he's a harassing piece of shit.,"Me with my wife , at a party a friend inappropriately touched my wife. Over the weekend, me and my wife visited the birthday of an ex-work friend [32 M] (let's call him Ted) which was at his house. There were about 10 - 12 people at the birthday party. At some point in the evening I was talking to a bunch of people at the party when my wife stepped out with a few people to smoke a cigarette. --- While she was smoking a cigarette, Ted also came out to smoke a cigarette with the group. Then while smoking he casually placed his hand on my wife's ass. My wife was quite shaken up and came back inside. She didn't mention it to me till the following day at which time I recollected seeing her coming in looking a little shaken up. I had asked her at that moment if everything was fine, but she'd just smiled and said ok. When me and my wife spoke about it the next day she mentioned that this had happened once in the past as well, but she'd thought it was accidental that time around, but this time when he did what he did, she was certain it was on purpose. Another odd thing that happened was that he called us the following day to say thank you for coming over to the party and then asked said thank you to my wife as well. In retrospect I feel he wanted to gauge how things were at our end and if my wife had discussed it with me. My wife and I discussed and we're certain that we're not going to any parties at his house anytime in the near future nor do we socially want to meet Ted or his wife together. --- Ted had been pretty wasted the night he did this and I don't think alcohol is an excuse which will cut with either of us. I'm angry to say the least, and definitely want to break what ever little I have to do with him. I don't work with him and cutting him out of my life is pretty easy. I would just like to know how do I go about this from here. --- **tl;dr**: Friend touched my wife's ass at a party. Do I confront and cut off ties or simply cut them off from our lives?"

I'm out of the loop on this. I've noticed many chatters who've been around and contributed since the own3d days that don't frequent that much anymore. I've also noticed a lot of new guys shitting on the old memers and bullying behaviour that's been going on mostly in chat, but also in this subreddit. There's also a lot of resistance presented whenever people want to see some more other games than League. The Starcraft hate is especially prominent and mostly among new chatters and non-subs. Figure they might've joined when Destiny switched to League and don't know what Destiny is known for. But it might also just be a generation shift and people are moving on. Can anyone fill me in?"

0,race you to the drop,"I hate you r/headphones Two days ago I was happy with my audio setup and had no plans of changing anything anytime soon, just two days ago. Sure I knew that at some point I'd pick up some HD 650's and the Magni 2/Modi 2 for them, and maybe even some used LCD-2's if I found a good price for them, but I wouldn't be doing that for years. But Massdrop just had to announce the HD 6XX and how could I not buy those? $200 for HD 650's? That's a no brainer. Of course now I'll need a DAC to use with them and I'll want a decent AMP to go with it, perfect time to buy that Schiit stack. Well since I left the audio market Schiit has come out with the Jotunheim and every review I've seen of that has been glowing (thanks u/ZeosPantera) so of course now I'll be getting that. The Jotunheim comes with a 4 pin though and I would love to take advantage of that so I'll probably get a XLR cable for the HD 6XX and maybe I'll pick up a XLR to mini XLR cable for my Q701's while I'm at it. Well that's going to cost at least $800 and I'm not even finished. Now that I will have a proper setup I can use the Jotunheim for my speakers, but I have Mackie CR3's, which are great and I love, but they're powered speakers and they wouldn't take advantage of the Jotunheim so I'll want to change those out for something else. I have no idea what I'll change those out for but I'm sure it will cost me another $500 to do. Sure I'll probably sell my Fiio E12 and my Mackie CR3 but that will only get me like $200 maybe, which is not much considering what I'm about to be spending. So I'm very excited about all these things I'm going to be getting, but I hate all of you for killing my bank account, especially you Massdrop because you started this. TL;DR: I'm back"

AFAIK, the Echo only records ""everything you say"" only in that it's waiting for the wake up word (""Alexa"" by default). So it has to listen in order to wait for the word. However, Amazon has said that none of that conversation is purposely stored anywhere. What the police are banking on in this case is that purposeful interactions with the device will establish a timeline and identify certain people that interacted with it. If they get really lucky, the device may have mistaken a word as ""Alexa"" and started recording. In which case, it might have stored a bit of conversation (like ""I Bob, am totally going to kill you, Steve, right now""). They also want to dig into the hardware and find the memory buffer within the device that might hold a few seconds of sound that it holds while the device evaluates what it hears for the trigger word ""Alexa"". In other words, Amazon is not recording all your conversations, and now the police/government can get at them at will. They have your laptops and cell phones for that purpose."

0,When I played COD 4/WaW I felt like I was in Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan.,"IW Map Discussion Disclaimer: I'm acutely aware that I haven't seen every map nor have I played the game for longer than a weekend; however, I have seen a preview of upcoming maps and have also noticed a trend since MW3 regarding map design. With that said... How is everyone feeling about the maps they've seen so far for IW? - Corridor shooter. Maps just feel like they're made for arena purposes. - Maps have basic geometry blocks instead of real obstacles. Instead of strong map design they decided that at random area 'X' that there should be a cube. Not a downed helicopter or tank, but a random cube. Instead of cleverly blocking off areas I constantly found myself breaking the suspension of disbelief and realizing that block 'X' was put here just to stop my progression forward. - Maps seem too sterile. This one is hard to put into words but when I see maps like Throwback or Frontier it just seems like they're going through the motions. Perfect angles with nothing else going on in the map. It looks like it was created in Halo Forge mode. - No heart. Go look at Crossfire or Overgrown and you can see the sweat put into the map designs. These were unique and impressive maps that will be remembered for their strong gameplay. Maps now seem like throwaway maps to be forgotten in a year. - No immersion. When running through Crash I could feel like I was in a real area shooting through real buildings. Now I'm just running through generic building 'A' without any sense of actually being in the map. - Limited verticality. How many maps is someone in floor 2 of when you're in floor 1? I haven't seen many. In Precinct there were a few areas where you're in the 2nd floor of a building but with no other floors it was really just an extension of 1-level gameplay. You ran past the building and you knew that if someone was in there they would be in the 2nd floor. Compare this to Crash where you have, by my count, 5 buildings with multiple levels. TL;DR: The maps feel incredibly basic with no lasting impression meant to be left. It's like they're just churning these out because they have to at this point. Your thoughts?"

The most recent patch said it fixed them, and they may have gotten SLIGHTLY better, but they are in no way fixed. I was killing a titan, and it became doomed, so I went in for the execution, spamming melee, I hit it about 4 times, nothing. In that time, I lost enough health to get doomed myself. And the very titan that I'm trying to execute... executes me. Wtf? It also happens in pilot combat. The executions don't occur. It's not as bad, because you still end up getting a melee kill. But for the challenges, and the general sense of pride when executing someone, it's greatly missed. I hope that it gets fixed completely in the future. Until then, I will continue to die in my Ronin when trying to execute someone!"

0,"This would be awesome, but I don't think this game really needs saving","I think a ""forge""(halo) / map-building game type would really save this game Hear me out. Like halo and GTA they have very devoted communities that share and put out a lot of interesting game types and maps. With the fast pace movement / momentum systems in the game the options are really endless. Just off the top of the head this logistical side makes a lot of sense as well. Respawn doesn't really like to get too involved with the community. Other than making the interface where all these maps and game types are held the communities should grow themselves with little to no help from Respawn themselves. Thus creating more incentive to get into the game for people on the outside and incentive for people already playing to play Titanfall longer. Once people start sharing what they have made in game it is only a matter of time before someone posts it to YouTube and reddit and gets people head turning with pilot races or titan death arenas, displaying a freedom not found in Call of Duty or Battlefield 1. This game really needs a identity for the casual gamer and bringing an unexpected goofy / creative as fuck, aspect to this game might MIGHT be what it needs. I understand that making of the map-builder interface could be hard but you could just keep it vague and use the backdrop of the cool pilot training exercise from the beginning of the campaign. That is just an easy way to tie it all in with the overall game and not like halo where you take an already existing map and drop shit on it. I dunno just a thought."

0,Call the code violation part of your city.,"Friend suspects multiple families living in downstairs unit; landlord unresponsive. What are her options? (NJ) My friend lives in the upstairs unit of a row home in NJ with two roommates. Her downstairs neighbors of two years are a Muslim family with three kids, ages 6-12. She does not talk to them because there was an issue a while back where the father and a former roommate got into a screaming match over parking spots that soured the relationship. The units share a front door that opens into a landing with their door, then stairs upstairs into my friend's unit. My friend just called me at her wit's end. For the past six weeks suddenly there are 20 or 30 people in and out of that downstairs unit, mostly children but also younger women in hijab. She says suddenly there is a baby crying at all hours and she never saw the mother pregnant (they occasionally cross paths in the downstairs laundry). She'll leave for work in the morning to five or six women standing inside on the landing, and then come home from work and they'll be teenage boys on the porch hanging out of the front door. The family has also left ""the contents of a Payless"" shoe store all over the landing; meaning the floor she has to cross to get to her stairs to her apartment is covered in shoes where before they neatly stacked them on a shoe rack by their door. This is both in the morning and in the evening, so she things the people are staying their overnight. She contacted her landlord on Saturday because she is concerned that either multiple families are now living in the unit beyond it's three bedroom capacity, or that they are running an illegal daycare/babysitting service (because kids, moms, and babies). Her landlord has as of Thursday not responded to multiple text messages and calls, although he cashed the rent check she left in the garage mailbox on Monday so he had to have been at the unit. She has no idea what to do. She lives in a shady area and is concerned about all the strangers leaving the front door unlocked. The baby cries at all hours. Strange cars are taking her units' designated spots. Since her landlord is refusing to answer the phone, she feels like she's out of options but fears for her safety. I advised calling the police to file a noise complaint, but she is genuinely concerned if she reports the family to the police they will be discriminated against for being Muslim or otherwise unfairly targeted due to recent events in NJ. I also suggested she look at her lease to see what her rights are, but what should she do? What options exist for a tenant when the neighbors are jeopardizing her safety and the landlord is unresponsive?"

Add to that: * Continued uptick in anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant violence driven by Trump's rhetoric * Empowerment of rape culture thanks to the new groper-in-chief who believes he can do whatever he wants to women because he's famous * Trump's plan to make it easier to carry out his pattern of libel-bullying by suing media critical of him * Trump's open invitation for Russian hackers to attack his political opponents This shit is really scary.

0,Boosters are not tradeable there is no reason their lasting missions rather than time would affect prices in any way.,"The kill joy for the working people: Boosters I think it's bad design for us, the customers, to have boosters last x hours only, regardless if you are logged in or logged out. If you can't play Warframe ""full-time"" every day due to IRL getting in the way, the boosters are nothing short of wasted. First off, since we can't play that often, there is - let's say - a bigger incentive to buy an affinity or a ressource booster in order to cover some ground. Because for example with mastery fodder, you wouldn't want to spend weeks over weeks to get them to level 30. Now this is no issue at all, but therein lies another problem: *Because* we can't play so often, the boosters are really unefficiently used in our case and we get a lot less for our money. Let's say I would buy a booster for 7 days. If I'm only able to play on half of those days and then only for a few hours due to job life and IRL, I can't help but *feel* I just *wasted* platinum/money. It's a kill joy. Of course, I know, this is a commonly applied system in online games, but personally, I really don't appreciate it. But what would be the alternatives? If we take a look at the chinese version of Warframe, we see that they have boosters last for x missions instead of x hours. Now, it's debatable, whether this is the optimal way to go or how this would affect the market prices. However, I really think it shows that it *can* be done differently. So, I would vote for an *additional* set of boosters, which either only count down the time you are logged in or that last for a given number of missions instead of x hours. Since they would be more efficient, I wouldn't mind them being more expensive as well. But at least, it wouldn't feel so wasted to buy one then. What do you think?"

0,"Dropping a Concussion to swing a 1v1 in your favor or to disengage is something that had not crossed my mind, excellent point.","There are so many good uses for concussion blast. Good for quick direction changes midair to avoid enemy fire. Getting out of range of ults. Boosting back to the fight after a respawn. Others have mentioned separating Reinhardt from his team. Also nudging his charges off-course, and sending him out of melee range after he ults. I like to use it to push enemies away from my teammates caught in a zarya ult too. Most of all, though, it's useful to disrupt your opponent in 1 on 1 duels. Making McCree miss even one shot can be the difference between life and death. And the forced movement can make it easier to land that one rocket on a slippery tracer. It's easy to write it off as a low-impact move but used strategically, it's anything but. Boops are awesome, but they're just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this move's power."

0,Thank you!,You can to an extend. But just because an item is e.g. 250k on reddit and 235k on OPskins doesnt mean that you can compare these 1:1 imo. Lets say you got 250 keys and want to buy an item which costs 250k on reddit and 235k on OPSkins. To get the OPskins funds you would have to sell those keys to them (250*0.95=237) and you end up with a pretty similar price. (It also takes time to sell those keys). If you are starting with OPSkins wallet its better to search for cheap items than buying skins.

I for one feel there are just too many leagues in the scene right now and its hurting the scene over all. However, making leagues exclusive is not the way to fix this. I am conflicted if we should remove the flairs we have as it might indicate that we no longer support the players but overall I think it would be similar to emailing/contacting the orgs on twitter etc. Show you're displeasure by removing your flair if your favorite ORG is in PEA and is hurting the game."

0,"Minigun our insurgent pickup pretty good at dealing with those hydras, they work best if you have some cover","There need to be non-jet options for taking out jets. It's kind of silly that nine times out of ten, the only way to ""fight back"" against a jet griefer is to disband my motorcycle club and/or organization and go into passive mode, or find another session. I currently do not own the Hydra, so I cannot retaliate against these people. I own a Buzzard and a Homing Rocket Launcher, but as everybody knows, these options are useless against a Hydra. Generally I do not respond to Hydras when they kill me, hoping they will go away, but that does not always work. Especially as a President or CEO, you have a massive target on your back without saying a word, you frequently spawn objectives that reward them for killing you, and you are unable to go into passive mode, making you easier to grief. There needs to be a method of taking these guys out without resorting to homing missiles. A direct fire flak cannon, or something, would be perfect. You'd need to lead them a good deal, and the ammo would be expensive, but it could at least deter them from your airspace. Another option is a Merryweather option to scramble jets against him for a while. It would be expensive, and have a decent cooldown, but at least I could fight back by throwing money at the problem. ""Git gud"" is not a solution here, because there is no weapon for a person that does not own a Hydra that can put a dent in one, and especially not one for a person that does not own a Buzzard. With a Buzzard I can occasionally get lucky, but there should be a way to defend against these guys that is balanced by cost. Otherwise, it is nearly impossible to get any work done in a public session with a Hydra pilot marauding about. Prison buses and limo caravans are not exactly agile, move in straight lines, and are highly flammable. Hell even if you manage to get the guy out of the sky, he'll just respawn another Hydra."

0,343 should nerf the accuracy for the BR it's accountable for competitive and BTB.,"Do we need to talk about the Battle Rifle? Look, I love the BR just as much as anyone else, but I think it's a major issue. The BR is simply too powerful and too versatile for a load out weapon. I think that having the BR available at level 3 in warzone stifles the use of other low level req weapons, e.g. Blissful slumber, razors edge, open hand, Scale of Soirapt, even the Blood of Suban to a lesser extent. Now these are all kick-ass low level weapons, but the BR is batter (safer) to spawn with and use due to its short-long range versatility. I'd like to see more variation in the weapons people actually use; I feel like raising the req level for the BR to level 5 would achieve this. It would have the added benefit of making warthogs more useful now that gunners can't be picked off instantly by long range BR fire. Look I hate to be that guy, but is the BR even necessary at all? Now that we have a very good pistol for a load out and DMRs later on as an upgrade, should we even have the BR in the sandbox at all? It's just too powerful and too versatile!"
0,"Pink Diamond was already erased from the Homeworld logo and the explosion was white, blue and yellow, so no, she was dead but her death couldn't have caused that.","The ""Corruption Song"" Wasn't a homeworld weapon. So what caused the corruption hasn't yet been truly revealed in the show, but I noticed a lot of people assume that it was some sort of homeworld weapon. But I got an alternative theory. I don't think Homeworld, or the Crystal Gems expected the corruption. Because think about it, when Steven asked of corrupted Gems on Homeworld are different, Peridot told him that there was nothing like this on Homeworld. She had never seen a corrupted Gem before. If Homeworld had the ability to corrupt gems, would Peridot know more about them? My idea is that the corruption was a side effect of Pink Diamond being shattered, thus making Rose indirectly responsible for the corruption. To me, this makes a lot of sense for the story. It would explain why Rose wanted to cure the corruption so badly, because she felt responsible for it. Also, Monster Reunion, when Centipeedle is ""drawing"" the story of the corruption song. Most people believe it was a weapon, because it came from the sky. But remember, the Sky Arena. The Battle against Pink Diamond could very much have taken place there. Also, when Steven asked what it was, she drew the symbol for the Diamonds, also hinting that it could be a Homeworld Weapon. However, note, she draws it without the Pink Diamond. Of course, this could be because Pink Diamond was shattered before this, and they changed the logo when she was shattered, but I personally don't feel that's right. Also, IMO, it just doesn't make sense to me why Homeworld would turn a weapon against it's own soldiers. Granted they're suppose to be kinda ruthless, but it just doesn't make strategic sense to me, and a waste of good soldiers. Also, if they really did use it as a weapon, why did they retreat afterwards? It would have been a success if only four of the Crystal Gems survived, after nuking the planet, why not push the advantage than? Because they had just lost a leader, and tons of soldiers. As far as they knew, the Crystal Gems were responsible for that, and didn't know that the Crystal Gem forces were mostly wiped out by it too, so they decided the planet wasn't worth it anymore. A lot of people think the shattering of Pink Diamond was the START of the gem war, but personally I think it was the END, and what caused Homeworld's retreat."

1,"Yeah, I mean look what happened to Britton last night ... oh wait, they forgot to use him","I'm of the mindset that none of this matters come playoff time. Pitching/hitting splits against specific pitchers/batters, home/away, how ever else you wanna slice it doesn't matter when it comes to the playoffs. Its a whole new season. I've been watching baseball for a while now (probably short in comparison to some of the older guys/gals on this sub), and I have seen the most unlikely heroes step up in a time of need. In the 2004 ALCS, I remember the ridiculous splits Mariano had when entering the 9th with a lead, and look how that ended up. So I like to think that anyone can step up or fall of a cliff come October. Go Sox."

0,"Does it happen to say ""Don't apply directly to skin"" on the pack?","TIFU: By putting an ice pack directly on my skin. Well, unlike most of TIFU this actually just happened today. I was laying in bed and my arm had gotten sore, when I rolled over it felt like I had pulled a muscle. So not wanting it to get any worse I grabbed a big ice pack from the freezer and began to apply it to my shoulder. 5 minutes later I decided to remove it and see how my shoulder felt. This was when I realized I had fucked up.... My skin on my shoulder was literally frozen and white with frost. It was weird because I didn't feel the usual tingly feeling that shows maybe its time to take this cold pack off... Now I have a big red spot on my shoulder and am hoping it doesn't blister up. TLDR: Had sore shoulder put ice pack on with no barrier and got ice burn."

Steve drove up by where they were and told them the Blazer would be gone in the next few days because he sold it. I found that curious...after all that supposedly happened the night before he wants to let them know he sold the blazer. Which makes me think, he got a call from the buyer the night of the 31st, or maybe that morning. It's just a slice of SA's demeanor I think, on Tuesday morning."
