0,They're slowing down but every now and then they buy another % or 2 of the shares... At this rate pretty soon they'll have to make a public offering because of french law.,"Vivendi IIRC. They recently took over Gameloft and tried to get Ubisoft by raising their holding stakes (since they lost Activision-Blizzard a few years ago thanks to them buying themselves back, so they're looking for another game company to grab). They failed however. I still have some hope in Ubisoft to be honest. I mean, Rayman Legends was just too fucking good and they've confirmed Beyond Good and Evil 2 is finally going forward in development."

On the other side you have Trump, who in the past CONTRIBUTED MONEY TO CLINTONS CAMPAIGN, lives in Trump tower, and runs alongside born and bred politician Mike Pence, somehow convinces salt of the earth middle America that he is their man. You want to talk MSM brainwashing? There's so many steps between Trump and the common man, along with his ""drain the swamp"" strategy that you literally have to be brainwashed to buy it.

0,Currently in stat and holy shit this just helped enormously in getting the concept of P tests down,"This isn't that hard. I'm not going to go all hypothesis testy for this, but we can certainly calculate a confidence interval on his measurement. If we believe that p = 1/3 and we have enough data points (which at nearly 300,000 we do), we can estimate a standard error for our measured p using sqrt{p(1-p)/n}. A 95% confidence interval would then be 1.96*se(p) = 0.00086. Given the actual data we can say with 95% confidence that misha's true summoning rate falls within the interval 33.38% +- 0.086% or [33.29%, 33.47%]. Increasing n an order of magnitude to just about 3 million games, would bring the lower limit of our confidence interval to 33.35%, which is above 1/3. We would need about 3 million games to more properly test the claim that Misha might be summoned at a rate higher than 1/3. (at least for p-value of 0.05 and a 2-sided interval, and maybe other things I'm forgetting at the moment.)"

0,No way...I just got first place in the Fast Egg Shaped Piece of Animal Skin Filled With Air Carrying Competition at nationals,"If you can run really fast carrying an egg shaped piece of animal skin filled with air, they'll give you about anything you want at the school of your choice. Even more stuff can be had if you can consistently throw it through the air to another guy."

0,Price :),"What do you think Battlefield 1 should improve on just before the launch? Is it just me because I believe the player models need to have some blood where the injuries are. Such as in melee animations to add some immersion and details to each player model. When I play games I really love the small details that just impresses me, since most games these days (looking at COD) who don't put the small details in. The video of how Ubisoft downgrades really opened my eyes and even though the Battlefield series is nowhere close I just fear that someday video games will just be entertainment and not art. Dice has done a great job and Im not dissing them, but if somehow they could pull this of I would be extremely impressed."
