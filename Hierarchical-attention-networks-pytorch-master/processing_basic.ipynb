Remember BIL is dating now SIL and he's now thinking of marrying her. We were sitting in the room at the il's house just us three. BIL is talking to DH about it. SIL has a dog that she's had for years. It was a gift to her by her father when he became very ill, near death. The reality hit him that life is short and he decided to start making good on some of his promises before he died. He always told SIL he would get her a dog, they were a military family, and he'd always say the next place we move I'll get it for you. So he got her this dog at that time and she loves her dog and he has sentimental value to her. Now, BIL has not yet met this dog because you know it's serious when you meet the dog. BIL sates to DH: Well the dog has to go. I have allergies and I can't be living with a dog. I know the dog has sentimental meaning for her because of her dad but my health is more important than a dog. She's waiting for me to meet the dog because she wants him to slowly warm up to me. This is stupid, it's just a dog... I don't see what the big deal is. I want to marry her but if we get married we'll already have to get an apartment and that costs money there (both of them at the time were living with their parents and would meet each other for dates and such). If we keep the dog then we have to pay extra money for pet rent and I'm not paying extra money for a dog!!! DH is just nodding his head and listening (he's pretty laid back and quiet always like this guess it's true opposites attract). I'm thinking how rude is this guy? He wants to marry her and is supposed to love her but can't have compassion for what she loves??? I know he's SNOT JR. For sure. Anyway he meets the dog and they get engaged. They have all these big events that I find my way out of because I can't stand being around them. They had a family celebration right after he proposed and a joint couple shower. SNW knows how creative and crafty I am, especially after my wonderful diy wedding decor, so she asks me to help her decorate for the rehearsal dinner. I reluctantly agree to help her. DH and I have been married over 3 years at this point. SNW has never made any efforts to call, text, smoke signal, or communicate with me in any way or form any relationship with me. Can't remember if I posted about this before but I did invite her to an event to be the bigger person, but she basically fought me even giving it to her. The event was based on a book and I wanted to buy her the book and put the tickets inside as a Christmas gift. She was like oh I don't want a book. And then proceeded to text DH about how she doesn't want whatever I'm trying to get her, that he knows the type of gifts she likes and to stick to that. I was so angry... I was raised knowing when people get you a gift you accept because the person thought about you and took their time to get it for you so be grateful! Guess not everyone learned that. I still invite her after my moms advise but said well I was trying to do this for you but since you didn't want it I'm asking you now would you like to go with me. Then she's like oh I would love to go I had no idea thats what it was, super nice in front of everyone. We went to the event and she straight up did not talk to me the whole time and went off in her own during the intermissions. Sorry for going off topic but you get the point. Now all of a sudden she's blowing me up about this wedding rehearsal. She texts several times a day and calls about her ideas and sends me pics. She's always like Hi how are you then goes for what she wants... I'm not fooled at all, she never cared how I was doing for over three years. She says Oh well SIL and I have been talking about the plans and blah blah blah. Basically trying to run in my face that she talks to SIL all the time and she's being involved in the planning. unlike with my wedding, but that's because she got mad at me for not doing what she wanted and did CBF the rest of the time I was planning. I tell DH about this sudden change of behavior and how much involved SNW is in this wedding as compared to ours. He suggests well maybe because she has a good relationship with SIL she realizes she needs to do better with you and this is her way of reaching out to you... I say maybe but I know its all fake...\"]\n",

Here's my questions: 1) Is there any way I can quickly dry them out in an oven or something? Would they be safe to boil and use at that point? 2) Usually the things I've read say that the bark needs to be removed or it'll slowly peel off. As long as it were to not peel off in tiny pieces, and as long as it were safe, I wouldn't mind that. I don't have a sandblaster to remove bark with either.
